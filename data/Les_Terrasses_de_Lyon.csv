4.0,Epicureously,April 18 2022,1266,"We stayed 5 days in the hotel so booked the restaurant for the second night. There was a nice lounge for a pre dinner drink which was very tranquil like the restaurant. We had a nice table at the front line which has the best view looking over the town. The primary reason to go here. Although as a bit of advice, if it’s not summer they keep the glass doors closed which means that when it’s dark the view is your own reflection. I’m sure they open them when it’s warm. They did at lunch. The decor is modern but classy and there is a good feeling of space but still quite intimate. The menu was very good with various tasting options plus a la carte. We went al a carte. To start I had a very nice dish of raw prawn various ways in jus from prawn head. Main course was veal sweetbreads. Cooked superbly. Didn’t like the fact we were ask to choose our desserts at the beginning of the meal. In fact I cancelled mine as I was too full. Had a spoonful of my wife’s non alcahol baba. Nice but easily the weakest dish. Big wine list and sommelier very good. The real issue here is service. Very timid throughout and positively non existent at the end. It took three go’s to get the bill and when it came it took ten minutes to find a pen so I could sign the damn thing. They certainly weren’t short staffed but maybe short of high calibre staff for a Michelin restaurant. Overall a very good experience. I will return but for lunch next time.",2
4.0,Francois B,December 3 2023,135,"Family birthday meal. Lots of difficulty getting a reservation (weekdays on Wednesday evenings) even if booking 2 months in advance. Reception non-existent and no valet on site. Curious about the quality of the establishment. Very nice dining room with a beautiful view. Unacceptable service faults for a starred restaurant. The menus distributed to the guests had the prices…. When you invite your guests…. It’s a bit embarrassing, and the men are served before the ladies…. I must be old France!!!! The meal was good but some dishes lacked seasoning. On the other hand, great ideas for dishes that we don't eat often and which are original. The €135 menu promised a great experience but after tasting, we agreed that it was not up to the standard of a Michelin-starred restaurant.",2
4.0,gourmet 73,November 5 2023,8,"A magnificent view of Lyon, a very beautiful room with space. The service is good even if it was a beginner's mistake to get the wrong menu. The error is human. The dishes are of quality but we are left a little hungry...the garnishes are very limited, it deserves a little more. The price of the coffee and/or the cheese platter is excessive...it's regrettable and it doesn't make me want to recommend this very beautiful place. Customer support upon departure is almost non-existent...bad point!",2
3.0,MarineH,August 6 2020,16,"Staying at Villa Florentine for the week end, we decided to book the Michelin Star restaurant Les Terrasses de Lyon. Although the hotel is wonderful and the service quality up to the standards of Relais & Châteaux, we have been really disappointed by the restaurant. The staff was particularly unfriendly and inattentive - which is not what you expect from that kind of restaurant. Nobody was looking to serve us water or wine, we had to do it ourselves. Waiters did not explain the dishes, which is once again, something that should never happen in a Michelin star restaurant. Also very surprising, there was no “mises en bouches” and no wine pairing menu. I’ve been to many Michelin stars restaurants and this is the first time I had such issues.  The food was very good but lacking of sophistication in the presentation of the plates. We had a talk with the property manager who explained us that it was not the usual staff due to COVID 19 circumstances, and that they did not had the time to train them like they would usually do. I find it a real pity as the menus were not less expensive even though the service and quality was not as good a usual.",2
3.0,Rebecca A,October 8 2021,194,"The service was awful. Our order was taken promptly but we attempted several times to get the sommelier to aid us choosing a bottle of wine and we never saw them. We had to ask repeatedly to get simple things like a water refill. The wait staff was busy pouring wine for other tables and we had to waive for them to if we wanted anything. We saw several trays of food waiting to be served while the waitstaff was busy pouring wine. The food was quite good, but we had to send some of it back because it was not hot. It was very expensive for such lack luster service.",2
3.0,760judith,June 18 2022,12,"Staying in the (glorious) hotel, Villa Florentine, we'd booked here for our first night and expected it to be one of the highlights – but sadly no. First, the phots are a bit misleading, implying you can eat on a terrace overlooking the town, but in fact it's just a room with a view. Second, I think Michelin needs to review its star: the four-course menu we had was lacked flavour, imagination and artistry. Third, the extensive wine list only catered for those with refined palates and deep pockets – the very few cheaper bottles cost €85. The next night we had a superb 7-course tasting menu and a bottle of (very drinkable €40) wine at the gorgeous, equally Michelined Monsieur P for around half the price.",2
2.0,Gourmand548,August 7 2021,2,"Me and my wife visited Les Terrasses de Lyon in the end of August 2021. We have eaten in many Michelin starred restaurants over the years and unfortunately Les Terrasses de Lyon does not live up to the general requirements and criterias of a one star restaurant.  The setting is wonderful and the restaurant is nicely designed. However, we were very surprised by the extremly low quality cooking techniques and we didnt really experience a large harmony of flavours in any of the dishes:  - The amuse bouches we ordered were quite ordinary and one, that was an alternative due to an allergy, consisted of a small piece of dark bread with a vegetable on top!  - The pithivier we were served as a main course wasnt, as it usually is, served as a whole at the table but was instead already cut up, divided and served/presented directly on the plates in a very non attractive way. Besides it didnt taste fresh but rather something that had been warmed up in a micro- wave oven.  The bread that was served was a very ordinary brekfast bread served without butter. When we asked for butter we got the same packaged butter as we had been served at breakfast at the hotel in which the restaurant is located.  The service was nice enough but the main part of the staff didnt seem to have any experience at all of service at this restaurant level and it was obvious that many people in the staff had been newly recruited without being offered any proper training by the managers. It all seemed very unorganised and unccordinated.",2
3.0,TracCao,May 29 2022,140,"The restaurant has great potential - fantastic views, lovely bar section, modern decor done tastefully and on paper, a menu that should deliver. However, after two dinners at the restaurant, I am afraid it falls well short of the mark. The first issue is the service and a major one. The restaurant has my full sympathy with staffing challenges and on each occasion, the service simply unravels after the entree after the 8pm as more guests arrive. On the second dinner, we simply had to serve our wine and water and simply left after the main course as we did not wait forever for the deserts. The second issue is the food. On both occasions, the food was not great. The chicken I had was dried, the trout entree was bland and lacking flavours and the desserts on the first night was uninspiring. It is almost the kitchen had run of passion. So Les Terrasses needs to improve and I hope it does as it has the potential to be a premium dining destination if someone wants to put the love into it.",2
1.0,melmelimel,May 31 2024,28,"Great disappointment for this table which should have amazed us a priori. The menu looked tempting, as did the setting. So on paper we were going to have a good time. Accustomed to large restaurants, we were generally disappointed, both by the service (disordered, even non-existent) and by the dishes. No dedicated server, so in the end no one took care of us. 30 minutes to receive the menu, the same for the wine (arrived after the appetizers) etc etc. This is by far not worthy of a star rating. Let's move on to the dishes, the starter ""fish soup, foie gras, asparagus"": A pasty jelly, rather cloying (couldn't finish the plate) and the foie gras non-existent. No chewiness, no crunch... For the main course, the skin of the fish was not properly cooked, resulting in a ""soft"" skin, which was not very pleasant. The accompaniments were good, no surprises. The meat was good, again without much emotion. For the chocolate dessert, quite good and successful, but nothing to rave about. We sent our comments on site. Apparently the waiter had received the same complaints before, but the chef did not take them into account to improve his menu. For the service, here too the manager seemed aware of the lack of coordination of his team, particularly on the side and back tables. No action was taken despite the countless number of errors.  We rate our experience severely, hoping that the chef will quickly reconsider, because without that, we very much doubt that the future of the restaurant will be under a starry sky. Unless the guide only notes the view of this establishment.",2
1.0,littleblackbook,July 9 2024,22,"We returned to stay at Villa Florentine after a 10 year absence - it’s just as special as ever. The same can’t be said of the hotel’s restaurant, Les Terraces de Lyon. A beautiful room with an enviable view of the City’s roof tops, but if the Michelin inspectors had experienced our sub-par food and service, Les Terraces would be lucky to retain its inclusion in the guide, let alone a prized rosette. I’d like to be convinced we’d caught them on an ‘off’ night (a new menu, about which the waiters knew far too little) but then I’d need to be persuaded to give it another try, and with 16 excellent/awarded restaurants within close proximity, I’ll opt for shy, over twice-bitten? A great shame, the charming hotel, the unique heritage and setting, the extraordinary quality/variety of local produce (and these disillusioned guests) deserve so much better! My wife insists that our previous night’s dinner at L’Assiette Champenoise in Reims (truly exceptional) had spoilt us, and set too high a bar. As always, she has a point!",2
1.0,Natalie D,November 13 2021,77,Not a Michelin star restaurant at all!!!  Very bad service - customers don’t count - waiters on theirs phones. We had to ask for water at least 3 times.. Food average - over salty and nothing special . Really nothing great. We came here for our 10 year anniversary and booked a month and a half before. So very disappointed and will never return. A real let down.,2
2.0,DESPORTE Y,December 14 2023,1,"A big disappointment Overall casual and unprofessional welcome and service A place without soul, despite the superb view of Lyon...the only positive point! International hotel restaurant type decoration...without charm We all dined “a la carte” Sophisticated and lean dishes with multiple combinations of flavors... so that it is almost impossible to identify the essential... ==>The ""trissotins"" of gastronomy are undoubtedly at the Terrasses de Lyon, on the slopes of the Fourvière hill! In addition....Very poor value for money Example: The (stingy) glass of Blanc de Blancs champagne at €29, stale and therefore almost without bubbles..... Conclusion: avoid! There are a thousand times better in Lyon....",2
2.0,Camelot359,September 5 2024,9,"A disappointing experience. We were encouraged by all the hype, but found all too quickly that our expectations were not to be fulfilled. Service level, despite the number of staff, was well-below par for a restaurant of this calibre. Perhaps a case of too many cooks? Staff seemed misguided and ineffective. After being shown to our table, it took more than 10 minutes to be asked about ordering drinks - in most restaurants the question would have been asked by the person taking us to our table. When it came time to order, despite the limited breadth of menu, we were informed that langoustine, duck and the beef fillet were all off the menu for the night. I am sure that there was some rational excuse, but that doesn’t help when you are left with limited choices. The finish main course was very good, however the veal was only lukewarm when served and was chewy. When asked how everything was, I mentioned the disappointment with the service and the quality of the veal dish. Of course the staff were apologetic but dinner was over at that stage, so not much opportunity to make things right. I find it difficult to recommend this restaurant based on our experience.",2
4.0,patrick l,August 16 2021,22,Great place to enjoy a gastronomic experience but... Service is great. Environment fantastic. Good food spoiled by a bread that is not what one would expect from such place. Especially if one want to experience the appealing cheese plateau. As it appears it is not the first time customers complain about the bread quality. And been in france and not solving this issue is really weird. It kills the great experience it shall have been...,2
4.0,Stéphane P,September 23 2023,171,"The welcome is warm and rather neat Renaissance menu at €135 We start the aperitif with a glass of Cordon Rouge Champagne For me a glass of Coteau de Lyonnais red wine… young and harsh! Oops ! Surprised to find this type of wine in a Michelin-starred wine! Let's hope that this false note will be erased with the sequel Let's start with some rather pleasant appetizers A new wine erases the false note of the first: a good quality Loire Valley Let's start the meal with the caramelized field tomato So how can I say... it's a beef heart tomato but without flavor... with tasteless seasoning and frankly no real taste Second false note! Damage Let’s continue with the crab and avocado cannelloni: A question comes to mind… is there only one chef in the kitchen?! The dish is fine, refined, tasty!! A true delight ! We really wonder how this tasteless tomato got here! The one-sided Arctic Char reminds us that we are in a Michelin-starred restaurant! A real treat... the cooking is perfect and the zucchini variations are a real delight! Finally, the smoked veal loin (we preferred it to the Pigeon) comes to majestically close this meal which... beyond the slightly complicated initial note... will ultimately have kept its promises! The Cahors which accompanies the meat is also very pleasant, although to be honest the wine pairings could have been more surprising! The pre desserts and desserts were up to par It was ultimately a good time!",2
3.0,Delphine P,August 6 2024,9,"The setting is perfect. The sublime view, we had a table by the bay window, really beautiful. A nice welcome, a sommelier of good advice and a professional and diligent waitress. Big table lovers, the ouaaah effect stops there, the cooking is unfortunately unsurprising, the foie gras without emotion, Rouget overcooked, Monkfish lasts so long it was cooked... Simple plates and no magic.... The chocolate dessert was very good, but we found the tiny portion...and all for an Award that does not match the performance..,, Too bad...",2
2.0,Gabriella B,September 19 2024,1,"Very disappointing. Particularly slow service. The lights in the restaurant are so strong that they are reflected in the windows, you can not even fully admire the view of Lyon. The appetizers were reminiscent of fast-food flavors. For the dish, I took can in 2 servings: 1st service, the meat was difficult to cut with unsharpened knives, the 2nd service: canned parmentier hash, far too salty, inedible! The experience was very disappointing. Failed birthday party.",2

3.0,Gunn Iren,September 6 2023,62,"The food was OK, but no more. Bad descriptions in the menu led to misunderstandings and the meal was uneven in quality. The fish dish from the six-course menu was very good. Otherwise just fine. Cheese was not part of the six-course meal! That was bad. The service was just right. The sommelier was not particularly good and the follow-up at the table was poor. We had to ask for more water because none came.",2

2.0,Rachel E,October 5 2024,3,"Despite its fame, this gourmet restaurant has not lived up to our expectations.

4.0,Christian A,July 28 2024,1,"I don't like to write reviews, but I've been itching for months now. The reason: the gap between the qualities of service and cuisine. We were six guests to celebrate my birthday. In short, I have rarely eaten so well. We chose the great menu... which was just perfect. On the other hand, after about ten minutes, I was forced to call a boy so that I could have the card and order aperitifs. Thereafter, even fight for wine. In short, it is a pity that cooking excellence is punished in this way.",2

5.0,GeorgeDubiecki,April 24 2024,5850,"We have stayed at Villa Florentine many times. This the first time in many years that we returned to Les Terraces restaurant. I hope that I can come up with the words to explain how good our experience was last night. We were greeted by Louise who is a very nice young lady. She greeted us in a warm and friendly way. Took us to our table. A beautiful corner table with glass exposing an amazing view of the roof tops and the Lyon city below. Adrien the sommelier then came to welcome us. He is very knowledgeable about wine and helped us. He decanted our bottle and serviced the pours throughout the evening. David our actual waiter came by to get us started. He is a young very polished professional. He understands exactly what it takes to take care of diners in a high end restaurant. He knew all the many answers that we asked him. He is also the cheese person. In charge of buying and selecting the cheeses. He did a BRILLIANT job in all areas. David had his team who would help deliver the dishes to the correct person at the table. We began with bread and butter. There were two breads, multi grain and country bread. Both were really delicious. My first course was Arctic Char which had been charred. It was virtually raw in the inside. It was more white than orange. I am used to seeing Arctic Char look a lot like salmon. It was accompanied by beetroot and lemon, and the combination was lovely. My wife had the French Asparagus of the moment It was green asparagus and was great quality. My wife had the sautéed Charolais rump steak. It was cooked to her liking, medium well. It had cauliflower and a Chimichuri sauce. I had the pigeon from Anjou, cooked on bones. The legs were confit and the body was perfectly medium rare. Served with peas and licorice. It tasted great. Certainly not over cooked. The cheese course was a huge selection of ready to eat seasonal cheeses from different parts of France. David outdid himself as all the cheeses that we had were incredibly delicious. Our dessert which we decided to share, was Gluten free flour base. It was pistachio souffle, with pralines and green cardamom ice cream. A perfect dessert to end an incredible meal. In an incredibly romantic setting. The service and the food were all wonderful. I got to go into the kitchen and meet John Leon, the talented chef and his team. Including his really good pastry chef. The kitchen is very new and perfectly laid out to deliver what turned out to be a fantastic meal. Thank you everyone for such a beautiful evening.",2

5.0,GeorgeDubiecki,December 24 2019,5850,"Well, usually I try to avoid celebrations that have everyone eat the same meal. They pre prepare all food. This fit most of that description but the food was delicious. They were very careful to address my wife’s allergies. We began with amuse bouche consisting of a mushroom tart. It had great flavor combinations including vegetables and of course mushrooms. Smoked salmon with cream and salmon roe, was really good. There was also a potato with an oyster that turned small but delicious. We each had a glass of Champagne, “Amor De Deutz”. Brute 2007. Our first course was like a cold soup of leek and potatoes puree in caviar form “Maison Prunier”. It was actually quite delicious, soup or not soup. This was followed by duck liver and smoked eel terrine and slices of granny smith apples. It was a great combination of flavors. The roasted back of sea bassin a shell fish sauce was terrific. The sauce was pineapple and curry emulsion. It was accompanied with risotto stuffed with truffles in crispy outer skin. That was wonderful together. Last main course was regional poulard in black truffle and a crunchy parmesan cheese biscuit. The poulard wrapped around a black truffle stuffing. All that with a great mushroom cream sauce. With the two courses above we drank a 2014 Gevrey Chambertin Clos Prieur by Marc Roy.  It was recommended and lived up to it. The service was perfectly professional. It was way better than I normally expect at a celebratory holiday dinner. I really commend the manager Pascal. His team is made up of young waiters and sommeliers who are professional way beyond their years. They were always on top of things and with a wonderful attitude. That starts with the manager. Theo was our main waiter. He was really great. He explained each dish as it was delivered. He performed with a smile and was one step ahead on everything. We asked for recommendations of things to do in Lyon. He took the time to write out those recommendations. I have to say Pascal, the manager worked very focussed, and was results driven, yet he was congenial and stayed on top of everything. This is a very well run restaurant. Erwan and Clement the Sommeliers were really knowledgeable-and helpful. All the staff were constantly looking for which table or people needed help. The dessert selection of yule-log cakes and candies does not begin to describe what was in store. There were three yule-logs and more than 20 candies to choose from. Basically you could “select” as many you want. By the way the desserts were amazingly delicious. You may get the idea that I really enjoyed this dinner. Well, I did. If you get a chance come to this for a wonderful meal and expert treatment by all.",2

Today we travelled all the way from Paris to Lyon to eat a nice meal and made the worst choice ever by selecting this restaurant ! We were given a table in the most isolated dark corner and as we seated asked to have a table near the windows. The manager said they were reserved but thoughout the whole meal we were the only table eating ! I had to get up many times to serve my own water and refill our wine ourselves. There was no staff on sight at all ever, it was a ghost restaurant.

5.0,Joseph C,October 28 2018,802,"We have many French friends as a consequence of my wife having working for/with a French company and we went to Lyon for a wedding dinner nearly three years late.  Simply put, they were in Asia at the time and we could not get there. They now live near Lyon so we met them at Les Terrasses de Lyon to celebrate belatedly.  It went well, we talked, ate and drank good wine together in Les Terasses. Having cabbed up, we were inside an area with a clear view from the heights of the Vieux Lyon with windows at an angle so that we could see central Lyon directly as well as up and down the River Valley.  It was not summer obviously, or sunny so the terrace that sprawls outdoors from the Villa Florentine were not open, only the better to be spoiled by a splendid staff.  Form of the food, i.e. its presentation, is both artistic and delicious - also difficult to recount in detail because we were also catching up and I did not make notes. We took a set menu, enjoyed excellent wine and we will return when I can take notes.  The restaurant staff have a degree of joviality, under control but pleasant, as maintain a discreet repartee. The food is beautiful and good. Some pictures will help.

Located in the 5-star hotel Villa Florentine, overlooking the city of Lyon on top of the Fourviere hill, Les Terrasses de Lyon, managed by Chef David Delsart, offered diners a culinary treat by using the regional produce to create true gastronomic wonders. Seated at the terrace with a breathtaking view of the city’s rooftops, I ordered a glass of Amour de Deutz champagne (€26) to start. Even though the weather was a bit hot, with the slight breeze it was in fact quite comfortable. We decided to go for the Discovery Menu, with me having 4 plates (€115) while Ivy having 3 plates (€105). I also had the wine pairings too (€85). After serving us a nice amuse-bouche, the starter was a cucumber gazpacho with a slice of toasted cracker on top, supplemented with some cheese and an edible flower. Very fresh and appetizing, the delicate flavors of the cucumber was enriched by the cheese and the cracker adding the crunchy texture too.  The first plate was Arctic Char in Gravlax, Broccoli and Quinoa Tabbouleh, Victoria Pineapple Emulsion. Gravlax was a Nordic style of cured fish which was able to keep the flesh moist and tender unlike smoked. The Arctic char was beautiful, and the pineapple emulsion added a sweetness and lightness to the full-bodied fish. The tabbouleh was a finely chopped salad which was flavourful. A great dish. Paired with Domaine Courbet Cotes du Jura Chardonnay 2015. The second plate was Pan Fried Duck Liver with Shrimps, Crispy Vegetable Salad. Interestingly when served a consommé was poured in with the duck liver, reducing the fatty sensation but further enhancing the flavours of the dish. The vegetable salad again provided a contrasting texture to the soft duck liver making the overall experience surreal. Paired with Bernard Zito Cote de Brouilly La Cote 2014. The third plate was Roasted John Dory Aiguillette with Saffron Butter, Zucchini Fideuà. Taking the inspiration from Spain for sure, the fish was simply gorgeous, with a crispy skin, moist and juicy flesh, seasoned perfectly. The saffron butter was delicious and did not mask the taste of the fish, while the fideuà was a Valencia-style paella. Really wonderful. Paired with Domaine Benoit Ente Puligny Montrachet 2015. The fourth plate was Pigeon Fillet from Anjou Smoked with Vine Shoot, Local Garden Peas and Strawberries in Pistachio Mustard. The pigeon was cooked right to medium rare, while seared greatly on the skin, with a smoky fragrance from the vine shoot. The appealing red and green creamy mousse was great not just on sight but also on taste. Paired with Domaine Jamet Syrah Collines Rhodaniennes IGP 2016, a chic wine from Northern Rhone which was famous in France.  Finishing the main courses, we were served some sorbet and fruit to cleanse our palate. So far up to now the portions and everything were so perfectly done it was truly a treat to dine in this restaurant.  Wrapping up on dessert was Apricots Cooked with Honey and Wild Thyme, Dulcey Mousse. Nicely presented, the apricots got an amazing aroma from the wild thyme. Along with some nice fruit and a home-made apricot ice-cream, it was a wonderful conclusion to the meal. Paired with Chateau Tour des Gendres Le Saussignac 2014. An interesting sweet wine from Bergerac with an unique bottle shape.  With a cup of coffee to pair with the Petits Fours, we really enjoyed the meal and had a good time here. The food was great, interesting choice of wines for pairing and good match with the food, impeccable service with nice and friendly staff coming to explain all dishes and chatting with us throughout the dinner. The bill was €343 and worth every penny. Highly recommended if you were visiting Lyon.",2

Top class sommelier that would make sure the wine tastes right before pouring it into the decanter. We went for a tasting menu and it was just perfect - all local produce with a flavour of summer. We didn’t want to leave! Before dessert we tried the cheese selection accompanied by port and had a glass of Sauternes with dessert - perfectly matched together. It was indeed the most expensive meal of our holiday but guess what - worth every penny!",2

The food was amazing and imagimative. Eggs in syrah, smoked pigeon, chocolate souffle all superb. We were first asked if we wanted any champage; our negative response meant we werw then ignored for 20 minutes. We had to collect pir own wone and water off the side table as they certainly weren't gpimg to top up our glasses. All very disappointing.  They have a 400/500% markup on their wine.

3.0,Brentjane,April 15 2018,9,"We ate from the Traditional set menu. The food was excellent. The service was less good. There were excessive numbers of staff and communication between them was not good. An example of this was that we were served a course from one of the other set menus. It was intended for another table but, as it was not clear if it was another ""surprise"" course, it was only after we had finished eating we realised it was in fact the wrong food! When we asked the staff if it was intended for us they said, ""of course it is"", when clearly it was not! If they had fewer staff I am sure they would have realised their mistake but they didn't seem to work as a team.",2

5.0,Ulrik W,September 9 2017,95,"""Excellent, and don't believe the bad reviews"" was the title of my very first review on TripAdvisor. As somebody who is willing to put your name on a review you should be very careful about criticising an establishment. Your personal taste, expectations or wishes has nothing to do with a review. A negative review is more often a reflection on the writer than on the establishment. I have been to Villa florentine and dined at Les Terrasses de Lyon many time, and used it both personally and for business. Les Terrasses de Lyon is an absolutely first class restaurant that deserve its Michelin Star. The food, the service and the view is well worth the detour. I have read, with interest some of the more negative reviews. Lots of critique(Villa Florentine) but forgot to tell that they left an IPad on the roof of the car in the middle of Lyon, or that after having being offered replacement for all dishes, ate and drank, but walked out without paying (I was there). See if you can find them, Les Terrasses de Lyon and Villa Florentine are first class establishments that easily deserve the Michelin Star and 5 Stars for the Hotel. I am looking forward to my next visit",2
5.0,Bigwi11,September 6 2017,17,"Absolutely amazing food, wine and service! My wife and I loved absolutely every aspect of this meal. The view of the city as the sun went down and day turned into night is one that will not be forgotten. The wine list is long, extensive and caters for every budget, although heavily biased towards the nearby appellations of Burgundy and Rhone. The food was incredibly well balanced and perfectly seasoned as you would expect with a Michelin starred restaurant. Expect to fork out a decent wedge of euros for this experience, I highly recommend this restaurant!!",2

5.0,Jackie O,August 26 2017,219,"If you're expecting traditional French or Lyonnese food, you've come to the wrong restaurant. The chef here only does modern inspirations on the classic dishes and it is amazing. My husband surprised me for our anniversary dinner here having researched a ton of different Michelin restaurants. We had eaten at Paul Bocuse restaurant earlier in the week so we got a taste of the traditional Lyonnese food. That said, you can't compare the two. It's totally different.  The food delicious and pleasantly surprising (many of my dishes had to be catered for my food allergies) and the wine pairings spot on.  We really loved the sommelier telling us more about the region of the wine and why he selected it to go with each of our courses. Each pairing was perfect!!  Our first server wasn't the friendliest and we were a little nervous about how the evening would go with him being so rude. Lucky for us we ended up getting a different head waiter and sommelier assigned to our table who was downright friendly and helpful! They definitely made our evening far more enjoyable!",2
3.0,Bodil R,August 25 2017,1,"The ratings are only due to the location with a wonderful view and the fact that we ended up not having to pay for the meal, which was not satisfying. It was far from the normal Michelin star level and onestly, we do not understand how they got the star in the first place. The dishes were not balanced at all and totally lacked the wow effect. It would have been more ok, if the price had not been as high as it was. Compared to The Gourmand de Seze, which we visited the day before (at a much lower price), it is difficult to imagine how this restaurant ever got a star. And I have not even mentioned the things that went wrong with the service. The first plate was a total disaster, but we got it replaced with another, which was good service, but the dishes never hit the roof! So compared to all the other Michelin star restaurants we have been to during the last 25 years, this does not come in very high on the list!",2
5.0,DiscerningOnes,August 23 2017,504,"Les Terrasses de Lyon is a gem. From beginning to end, it was a wonderful, relaxing experience. Every dish was an artistic feast for the eyes.

Of all the fine restaurants we tried, if we only pass through Lyon in the future, this is the restaurant we’d want to return to.",2
5.0,Kimberly B,August 10 2017,126,"Forgive the hyperbole, but this meal was truly outstanding. We were recommended to come to this Michelin-rated restaurant for lunch, so as to be a little easier on the pocketbook. We were told to take the prix-fixe lunch menu, which was exactly what we did and it didn't disappoint. The location is perfect, right on the side of the hill on the way up to the Basilica (it's situated on the lower floor of the 5-star hotel, Villa Florentine) and they have a beautiful terrace overlooking the city (unfortunately the day we went it was raining so outside seating wasn't in the cards). But I digress! The meal was outrageously good. We took the ""Express"" menu, which was a choice of either an entree and main or main and dessert. We opted for the former and then added on a coffee, which was accompanied by a small platter of petits fours. This meal, which featured two little amuse-gueles to start with, plus a bottle of wine, came to a very reasonable €62 per person between 3 people. And what a meal it was! There was a first little teaser of an exquisite tomato purée tart on a crispy cracker and a tiny steak tarter bouchon, followed by a ""paella cream"" which had to be tasted to even remotely be described. The entree was a mint-courgette gazpacho accompanied by a cracker topped with fresh chèvre, tomato jam and tiny strips of anchovies, the main was pork tenderloin alongside a carrot coulis topped with every colour of carrot (in miniature) you could imagine. The service was impeccable, just as you would expect from such a fine dining establishment. This was the culinary highlight of my 10 days in Lyon, if not the entire last decade. My palate is still recovering from the veritable riot of flavours it was exposed to. Quite simply magical.",2

5.0,sssteveg,July 28 2017,1816,"This is a beautiful restaurant located about halfway up the Fourviere Hill, so it has an incredible view of the city of Lyon below. Unfortunately, the reservation we had made a full month earlier on the Fork site, didn’t get to the restaurant. I later found out that Fork had confused the date of the reservation, and the restaurant thought we were dining there 3 days later. I wrote to Fork to complain, but unfortunately, their response was inadequate and disappointing. In the future, if I make a reservation with the ""Fork"", I will check directly with the restaurant. Fortunately, the restaurant had tables, although we had to sit in an “inner room”, rather than on the beautiful terrace with its lovely view. Happily, the fabulous meal we had made up for any unpleasantness regarding the reservation, and we quickly forgot about it. Everything about the meal was excellent. My wife ordered a la carte, and I had the gourmet menu with 3 courses. There were 2 amuse bouche, one with 2 parts, one of meat and one of cheese. The other was a creamed paella. My wife ordered Dublin bay prawns with ceviche and wild turbot. My standout dish was sweetbreads with cauliflower puree, which was fabulous. All the food here was exquisite, with excellent strong flavors. We washed it down with our first bottle of  Condrieu white wine from the Rhone Valley. It was the first of many we had during this trip. This one was from Chateau Cuilleron. The bill came to 256 Euros, including the bottle of wine. The meal was well worth the price.",2

After a few Michelin-starred restaurants on our trip across France, this one was definitely one of the best in terms of the quality of food, which was very delicate and creative. The only downside was quite a slow service - we arrived at 20:00, the waiter took an order for our four-year old kid right away and she had a meal in about 15 minutes (great performance!), but ourselves, we were not able to order even at 21:00! I understand in this kind of restaurants there is no hurry, but perhaps this is too slow... Otherwise, certainly recommended!",2

5.0,davidlocke2015,July 5 2017,88,"This was our third day-time visit to Les Terrasses and we were thrilled to find it even better than on the previous occasions. The restaurant has a lovely interior and terraced dining space, overlooking old Lyon, the Saone River and, beyond that, more modern parts of the city stretching eastward towards the Alps. We selected the Tradition menu with wines by the glass recommended by the sommelier to accompany each course. We loved the ""truite saumonee d'Isere"", the spelt risotto with escargots, and the whiting served with fennel. The escargots, in particular, were spectacularly good - flavorful and tender. As Lyon lies between two of France's top wine regions, Cotes du Rhone and Burgundy, our sommelier suggested some excellent choices from those two regions. But he also recommended a central coast Californian ""Grenache Besson Vineyard"" - a wonderful surprise. Dessert, the chocolate carupano, delighted us with its artful and intricate forms and rich colors and delicate flavours. Service was attentive and prompt - impeccable.",2

4.0,susankavanagh,April 21 2017,79,"The main thing which attracted me to this restaurant was the fact that they have a vegetarian tasting menu. My daughter is not vegetarian and there were several menus for her to chose from, so we were both happy. The food was very good, although to be honest this is what I'd expect from a Michelin-starred chef. The vegetarian menu was imaginative and comprised dishes I have never seen anywhere else. I must admit when I saw ""black curry crumble"" on the list I assumed it was a mis-translation of blackcurrant, but it wasn't and it worked surprisingly well!  Prices are towards the top end of the scale for the city, but not un-reasonable given the quality and unique nature of the food. I would have loved to add in the wine tasting experience - which given the quality and amount of wine they were serving was very good value - but I wouldn't have been able to walk afterwards and we still had some sightseeing to do!",2

5.0,ScottSpiral,September 24 2016,144,"Venue - Les Terrasses de Lyon restaurant is located at the beautiful and luxurious Hotel Villa Florentine a 5 star hotel sitting on the Fourvière hillside overlooking Lyon. Dining Room – The main dining room is beautifully decorated in keeping with the feel of the villa. It is not too large and the tables are well spread so that you do not feel like you are on top of other dinners. In the warmer months you have the opportunity to sit out on the beautiful terrace which is a Staff/Service – From start to finish the service was impeccable. At one point as the waiter was opening our bottle of Champagne it exploded, fortunately he was not injured. Everyone was very apologetic but as we explained it was not his fault and the attitude of the senior staff was very appreciative of our understanding which resulted in them providing us with a beautiful bottle of top class Bollinger. Food – The chef has created a beautiful well balanced menu that has French undertones but incorporates a broader, modern Mediterranean feel. The textures and flavours matched to perfection and I suspect change with the seasons. Wine – Of course, French wines dominate the wine list and with the help of the sommelier it is easy to find some beautiful wines at a reasonable price. View – This is the piece de resistance, with the seemingly never endless view across the whole of Lyon. It is absolutely spectacular and very beautiful in the evening with the city lit up. This alone is worth a trip to the beautiful Les Terrasses de Lyon",2
2.0,EdVancouver,September 16 2016,64,"We were recommended by close friends who stayed at the Villa and suggested that this one star would not be haughty but congenial. I of Asian decent but get along well in French whereas my Caucasian partner spoke only English. We were seated by the window in a very quiet corner of the room near an exit. I guess this is where they prefer to hide the tourists. We asked for an English and a French menu from our server. The tasting menu did not look very appetizing and the selection for the evening did not work for either of us. Please check the menu before you decide to see what is available. There was stuffed rabbit, and some interesting fish alternative but I did not see anything Lyonnaise per se. There is a tasting menu where you can chose 4 or 5 dishes; or chose your own entrée, main and dessert or a vegetarian prix fixe or an Italian flavored prix fix. We both chose the Italian menu along with wine pairings (4 paired wines). The food was really delicious, creative, had different textures, and it was a wonderful taste experience. The paired wines were well chosen, each enhanced the flavours of the accompanying course. The service all along was fine - proper not friendly but professional. The wine Stewart was informative and the server explained the dishes sometimes it seemed by rote. I would say that the service staff have been well trained but lack a certain élan or experience that one needs for this industry at that level. Dessert was served with a Port and coffee. Extra sweets arrived with the coffee and after that no one came to quality check the course and after a prolonged time (30 minutes), we finally attracted the attention of the Maitre D' to ask for the bill. This wait really made the experience sour. Dinner for 2 - prix fix was 89 euros each; wine pairing 95 euros each - 2 aperitifs served on the Terrace before - total 300 euros.",2

The wine list is very extensive and one is assured of finding a wine to suit either price point or normally hard to find wines. We chose a Chateau de Meursault Pinot Beurot 2013 which was a stunning wine E55. Lunch menu is far less than at dinner and we found the E49 menu just perfect. Amuse Bouche of chèvre tart followed by small offering of prawns and quinoa with a coriander icecream quenelle. The entree of melon, dried jambon and balls of foam was quite a delight to both view and eat. Main course of veal with creamy polenta and mushrooms with a delicious sauce may seem a heavy dish for lunch but it was not, it was exceptional. Dessert a beautiful raspberry macaroon filled with light chocolate mouse. To finish a tray of 4 little treats of perfection created by the chef. There was not one thing about the whole experience that one could even think may be even a little below the expected standard of a Relais & Chateau restaurant. Dress at lunch was dressy casual.",2

5.0,chiclife,June 21 2016,344,"Had high expectations on this place considering its location, price and setting. I made a reservation 4 weeks in advance. I must say that when we first arrived, I felt that the staff were quite sterile and not overly friendly. The restaurant was quite and due to the weather (rain) we were not able to have a table on the terrace and had to dine inside. So our first impressions were not great as it took forever for someone to take our drink orders. We decided to order the degustation menu which was primarily vegetarian. The food was very impressive and full of flavour. The cheeses were particularly good as was the wine. We spent almost 4 hours here eating and drinking and the staff did not rush us out once. The bill was quite expensive but it was well worth it after all we had eaten and drank. The service got better as the night went by - not sure if this is because the staff member found out we were from Melbourne and he had lived there previously. The chocolate soufflé was good but I've had better in Paris. However, it was a great evening and I would recommend to those who would like to treat themselves in Lyon and on a nice day sitting out on the terrace would be perfect!",2
5.0,Seemore,June 17 2016,242,"Nestled within the Villa Florentine (an ancient Lyon Convent now a superb hotel) on the hill, this gem is a dining experience in all sense of the phrase. The presentation, service and taste are all top notch. Super wine list and full bar. It is pricey but very much worth it. The lights over Lyon twinkle and smile all night long. Whatever you order it will be amazing.",2

He said after a Gallic shrug ""of course you have time , make a night of it"" He was right , we came in to this superb restaurant at 8:15 and left at 12;15 much poorer , but enriched by a culinary epic . We just had the four courses , but with pre starters and pre and post dessert desserts it was about eight courses in truth . I had the Italian influenced menus , light , with a lovely blend of flavours . It featured the best prawns I have had anywhere , amazing pasta and crab and chocolate pud to die for . Others went into poetry about the pigeon and ecstasy about the cheese. The wine man was great , recommending some wonderful wines , including the best Gigondas in the galaxy . A wonderful night , even the Brandy Man was happy with his Armongac . The BILL - well don't ask , just pay it .",2
5.0,Roger D,May 21 2016,107,"A restaurant which on whatever lens used was magnificent.  Setting is high on a hillside, overlooking Lyon. On the day we dined there, it wasn't warm enough to sit outside, but the view was as good by the window inside.  We chose the lunch menu, which was spectacular value (49 euros for 3 courses). In other restaurants' offerings, there can be a weak course included, that wasn't the case here, each was a star in its own right. My personal favourite was my starter, which was a herb ravioli, with a slow cooked egg, with mushroom and hazel nut sauce.  Rather than a single bottle of wine, we opted for the wine flight, which was three glasses chosen by the sommelier to match our food. We went for the basic option at 45 euros, we were blown away by the wines offered - 2 we did not expect to receive for the amount we were charged. All round, an experience which will live long in our memories for all the right reasons",2
4.0,Julie M,May 13 2016,82,"The restaurant is in a beautiful location with fantastic views over the city. The restaurant is part of a hotel and we ended up in the bar as we were early, and even though they knew we were there no one came for us when our table was ready. The menu includes three set menus, fish, Italian and meat and veg as well as a la carte. The wine list is huge and we were given no guidance as to what would be a good accompaniment for our choices. We were served by a variety of people, it was efficient but lacked any personality, almost robotic! The head waiter was remote and uninterested, unlike service we have experienced in similar restaurants. Luckily for Les Terrasses the food is wonderful, a delight to behold and exquisite to taste.",2
5.0,classicgirl,May 10 2016,156,For a special dining experience - this was exquisite from the moment we entered. We were offered a selection of champagne as an aperitif seated at a table with a wonderful view of the city below. I don't really have enough superlatives to describe the delicious lunch menu (just check out my photos). This a one Michelin restaurant very worthy of the award. It's a must for our return visit. Service was superb - once the staff heard us speaking English they sent over an English speaking waitress to describe our dishes - we would have survived without this though it was a nice touch to make us at ease when sampling the delights. Wines begin at 45€ and there is an expensive selection. Champagne per glass is 19€ and lunch depends on your selections.,2
5.0,Michael D,April 24 2016,28,This a special place that elevates your mood and attitude. The moment you are seated you know that this restaurant will reward you with an extraordinary experience.

4.0,Sunny meads,April 19 2016,65,"No bad tables here. The food was interesting but disappointed in the choice of starters, prawns are my least favorite fish but included in 3 of the 4 starters. The service was perfect in every way.",2
5.0,GeorgeDubiecki,April 10 2016,5850,"Though we have been here a number of years ago this is a new chef.Chef David Delsart must be commended. He is magical in his subtleties. He blends many spices and flavours but they are in perfect balance and harmony. It is as though he divides the incredibly fresh ingredients into very small delicate portions and then marries them together to make the final dish. When I ate them I could enjoy each yet they were not separate. That takes talent which David is a master at. We started with Amuse Bouche of duck liver pate enveloped by a delicious crust of bread hollowed out to make room for the pate. My wife who is not normally fond of duck pate said that was the best part and the best she ever had. I had the Jumbo Shrimps with Stracciatella of mozzarella di bufala, parmesan cheese crumble and parma ham. Delicious and each flavour enhanced the next. With that I had an interesting white wine from Corsica, 2012 Camarelli French Taraburetta. It was really refined in its elegance and went perfectly with the dish. Another Amuse bouche was potato salad with finely chopped up vegetables and sardines. It was scrumptious. My wife had the Black Angus beef with chalots and stuffed leaf lettuce. She is not often vocal about her reaction to her dishes. She could not stop pointing out all the nuances of her dish. She loved every bite which was cooked exactly to her liking. She even left me a taste which was beautifully balanced in its flavours. We had the Luigi Righetti Amorone della Valpolicella DOC 2010. It was stupendous. It was especially good because it was served by the glass. It was full of fruit and had great structure. Both of which hid the huge alcohol. With that I had the Pigeon from Anjou smoked with wine shoot. Served with it were French Asparagus, barbajuans stuffed with poultry giblets. This dish was right up my alley. I love pigeon and giblets and they were fantastic and went perfectly with the great wine. We ordered the Hot Chocolate Soufflé for desert. It came with the most incredible home made vanilla ice cream. It had a soft biscuit with salt flower. Unbelievably delicious!!!! I finished with five different amazing cheeses. Charolais (goats milk) Toma Corsica ( sheep's milk) Beaufort (cow's milk) Epoisse (Cow's milk from Burgundy) My favourite cheese. Saint-Marcelia (cow's milk) What a treat to get such great cheese especially with out the long trip to US. The service was absolutely first class. Not at all obtrusive but absolutely there when you needed them. Each and every one of them. You can see why they have been awarded the Michlin Star. I highly recommend coming here for among the best meals anywhere in the world. I don't think the second or third star is far away. I cannot wait to come back.",2
4.0,Anglotraveller,April 9 2016,410,"Its a bit of a trek but overall I would say worth it was worth it. The restaurant (part of the Villa Florentine hotel) offers fantastic views of Lyon, inside is very elegant but perhaps a little bare. The food was terrific, beautifully presented and delicious, the portions not so big but you are there for the taste and the ambiance not a fill up. Service was well choreographed, attentive and discrete. Prices were a little hight but certainly worth it given the quality of the restaurant. Overall, worth a visit.",2
5.0,Degustation60,March 7 2016,28,Wonderful one star Michelin restaurant in a fantastic hotel. We had the tasting menu and it was both innovative and delicious. Still can't decide which was my favourite - was it the sea bass or was it the pigeon? Setting is also quite magnificent.,2

5.0,TAHES,November 6 2015,264,"My husband and I had a wonderful evening here. The sommelier provided an excellent recommendation for champagne to start the meal and then a white burgundy to accompany our fish. The service was unpretentious and excellent. The meal outstanding. The view over the city is beautiful although no one was eating on the terrace that night as it was 100 degrees. Yes it is expensive, but for a special dinner it is worth every penny.",2
2.0,Marebones2,October 11 2015,25,"We had a gourmet dining experience WITHOUT a view of Lyon. We were seated in the back dining room. Our view was of the arched doorway leading into the main dining room (with the view). Standing in the doorway was the wait staff (6-8 people) watching and waiting to serve. We had reservations, we requested a view, it was our 25th Wedding Anniversary dinner. Was it worth the cost of the meal? No. Lesson learned: Leave a restaurant if we reserve for the food and the VIEW and are not satisfied with our table.",2
5.0,lolatye,October 8 2015,16,"This place was just perfect, we went for lunch. It had the fancy feel with super accommodating staff. They were all friendly and more than willing to help with our questions. They were even able to cater to a gluten intolerance! They even had a dog bowl for a dog that was there, any place that is so welcoming deserves 5 stars in my book. The view of this place was superb, and it was close to Old Lyon so we were able to walk there right after lunch. The food was just as good as the view! You can do a la carte or a tasting menu.",2
5.0,divefan,September 26 2015,615,"The tables are well spaced and ambiance quiet, so you can have a nice conversation. The fanciful preparations of the food were pleasing to eye and taste.

Well, it was not disappointing at all! We had the perfect weather, the best table outside at the terrace with a charming view, received a warm and elegant welcome, impeccable service and enjoyed delicious, modern French cuisine. We opted for a Menu + a la carte and all the food was amazing! Last but not least, trust the sommelier - he did an excellent job for us and the wine he recommended was a perfect match to our meals. It is a fine dining, top-level restaurant, be prepared for it! Relax and enjoy it!",2
5.0,Brigitte N,August 30 2015,10,We had a fantastic evening at Les Terrasses de Lyon. We had the best spot on the terrace to watch the colours change as the sun set and the moon rose over the city of Lyon below. We enjoyed a delicious and beautifully presented degustation dinner served impeccably by a very professional waiter. The sommelier was very knowledge and friendly and suggested some excellent wine pairings. A wonderful experience.,2
3.0,hamdle,August 25 2015,20,Restaurant has a great outside terrace location yet we were the only couple not on it despite being residents and booking well in advance. When we asked to move they were unable to accomodate us and told us we would benefit from our location as the evening became cooler - given it was 30 degrees at 8.30pm the false flannel was not needed. Food was very good and service efficient albeit we could not warm to the staff who appeafred to believe they were the important inhabitants of the restaurant.,2
4.0,Wi11.i.am03,August 20 2015,110,"We arrived a little early for our dinner booking and thought we would get a drink at the hotel bar while we waited. Big mistake as no one was servicing the bar even at 7.00pm which I found quite odd and so too did some other guests. This was not a good start to the evening given the reputation of the hotel where the restaurant is located. After finally getting an aperitif we then went down to the restaurant and as we requested we were given a table on the balcony to take advantage of the beautiful view and watch the sunset over Lyon. The degustation menu was superb and beautifully presented and what you would expect from a michelin star restaurant. The wines that we requested from the sommelier were perfectly matched and enhanced the dining experience. The waiting staff were attentive, friendly and efficient but I just felt the service lacked the polish that I have experienced from previous michelin star restaurants. It is by no means a complaint about the waiting staff just an observation and the reason for my 4 star rating and not 5 star.",2
5.0,Randall W,July 25 2015,262,"We selected Les Terrasses de Lyon mainly because it was Relais & Chateaux. We were not disappointed. Located downstairs at the Villa florentine in Lyon, the restaurant/hotel is located on a steep hill, overlooking the city with stunning views across to the Alps. Staff was excellent, the venue was quiet and not at all cramped, opening onto a beautiful terrace overlooking the city.  I had the Longe de veau rotie from the fixed menu. It was delicious. My friend had the gnocchi, prepared in Fricassee de Gambas. In a city famed for food, this was a standout.",2

This property is almost impossible to drive to and that is a huge detraction to its' appeal. TAKE A CAB or don't come. The food was very good and probably not as good as we had jet lag.

4.0,Xicorea,April 25 2015,273,"We had breakfast at Les Terrasses de Lyon and were not impressed. We selected the EUR 25 gourmand petit dejeneur, which included a regular continental breakfast and other items, such as eggs, ham, bacon, fruit, etc. As one would expect from a five-star property, everything was of excellent quality, but I believe that for that price you can get a better deal in Lyon. Service was outstanding, on par with places of this category. The view of Lyon is nice, but we expected more. I guess we set our expectations too high overall. We looked over the lunch and dinner menu, which featured a series of international and Lyonnaise specialties, but were also price well above other restaurants of the same quality. Unless you are a guest at the hotel and prefer the convenience of staying in house, I see no reason to visit Les Terrasses de Lyon.",2
5.0,ADVDIV,March 1 2015,26,"Came here for a dinner of 5 with my family and had the most wonderful time. The menu offered a set menu and ala-carte dishes. My cousins ordered the set menu which was a 5 course meal whilst I ordered the ala-carte menu of a fish dish which taste great. My younger brother on the other hand ordered a steak which was massive and had a side dish of the risotto. The risotto was the most delicious and perfectly cooked risotto I have ever tasted (and I have had my fair share of risottos).  Although the menu was not extensive in choices or on the low to medium side of varieties, the service and quality of food was impeccable. Waiter and waitressed was very friendly and was absolutely not stuck up or rude. The atmosphere was serene and somewhat 'royal' as fellow diners was polite and none of them made loud obnoxious laughs or comments even after a bottle of wine or champagne. A truly royal and delicious experience. Would say that with 5 glass or Kir Royal, a bottle of red, 2 set menus and 3 ala-carte, and 3 deserts, it came to about 130 Euros per pax. Not a place for children below the age of 15 and outdoor seating are not available during winter.",2
5.0,EvaChroisty,January 31 2015,11,A one star Michelin restaurant.

5.0,NATinCPH,January 24 2015,580,"It was the first restaurant I visited in Lyon and I am yet to find a place that will beat it. The dinner on the last day of Fete des Lumieres was no exception to my usual enchantment with this place. Just the location is perfect, up on the hill, with a panorama of Lyon in front of you while you eat - spectacular especially in the evening. There was a special menu just for this night and we were spoiled and treated to poetry on the plate from amuse bouche to dessert. My favorites must have been - haute cuisine with a twist that the chef does so well. The macarons that were a part of the petit fours were so delicious that I commented on them separately and the lovely waiter brought me a few in a box to take home. The service there deserves a whole another review - they are top class but in a charming way, none of the stuck up attitude so many restaurant crews think should be a part of experience. The only thing I was not happy with was that - since I had booked a few months in advance - when I emailed a week before our visit to reconfirm, I was told that unless I pay a deposit my table booking will not be guaranteed. And what if I didnt email that day, how was I supposed to know that? Would I miss my reservation? The person I originally made the booking with had not mentioned it.  Otherwise - perfection. A big bravo to Les Terrasses de Lyon.",2

I especially enjoyed the quenelles, a specialty of Lyon. Everyone here cares that you have a great time dining in their restaurant, from the chef who comes out to shake your hand as you leave, to the waiters and even the busboys, who bring you that extra butter or a refill of your glass with a celerity that is almost clairvoyant!",2

Les Terrasses was on top of TripAdvisor and the reservation was seamless. Nice glass of champagne at the hotel terrace and the table was truly nice and peaceful as requested. We liked the layout of the restaurant: every table had some space. The service was a drama to follow. Nothing escaped the eyes of the young servants and the drama on the table was spectacular to follow. The portions were as illustrated in many pictures, only more elaborate and intelligent. The wine was decently priced.  Cheese plate offered in the middle of the dessert, which was much fun, pieces of art. The bill was yes not small but we felt we had invested in ourselves. The ultimate was when the chef escorted us personally to taxi. Unforgettable and a reference as top service.",2

Then, one of waitors brought a picture book beside her, who stopped crying and enjoyed it quietly. We were really impressed with his professional and sophisticated behavior, thanks to which we enjoyed our lunch very much. As for foods, some is quite good, other not so good, but desserts are super nice. Needless to say, atmosphere and view are very nice. The restaurant is worth visiting, if you can afford. At least the quality of services are extremely high, compared to most terrible restaurants in Lyon.",2

Everything about the evening was perfect; the setting, over looking Lyon; the courtesy, friendliness and attentiveness of the staff; and especially the exquisite food. The wine selected was not available, but the sommelier immediately offered a more expensive wine for the same price. Although the cost of the evening was not cheap, it was in line with what might be expected from a Michelin Star restaurant. We would certainly go back for a future celebration if in Lyon at the time.",2
3.0,CaWineGuy,July 12 2014,271,"Les Terrasses is a very good restaurant. The service is excellent, and their sommelier is amazing. The view is nice, but due to weather the terrace was not open, so everyone ate inside.  The problem is that the food is just not all that. The chef attempts to make excellent cutting edge dishes, but just does not quite pull it off. We started with two amuse-bouche cornets - one with Salmon tartare, the other with a Ratatouille tartar. The Salmon cornet was uninteresting; the Ratatouille one was excellent. Each course followed a similar pattern; there would be flashes of brilliance followed by pedestrian cooking. The Filet of Duckling was very disappointing, as the flavors were muddled and the texture was unappealing. One michelin star is no joke. To stay at such level a restaurant must continually perform well, and Les Terrasses is not up to the task. For three guests the bill came to 700€, which is expected.",2
5.0,Nick H,July 1 2014,54,"Cannot understand why this has only one star, we thought the meal was impeccable from start to finish and the chief sommelier selected tremendous wines. Faultless service with a view to die for, but you need to book well ahead to get one of the tables outside.",2

The wait staff were French Professionals. For them it is a not just a job but a calling. They are there when you need them and melt away immediately. This is very different from North American norms and so might seem as though you are left alone. But, all that is needed is for you to raise an eyebrow and someone appears. We rearranged our seating and faced out over the main room to see the evening lights of the city over the terrace, and had a delightful time 'people watching' since we were at the back of the restaurant floor. I would choose this spot again! The food was Michelin Star of which we were unaware. The Taste gave it away even though it was mentioned on the menu. The quenelles, a Lyonaise specialty were especially divine and quite spoiled it for any other restaurants in the city who had it on their menus! The cray fish was the best ever. Their wine list is extensive but the Som will be happy to help. It wins my vote for favourite restaurant in the city.",2

The chef cared so much about our opinion that he followed us to the door to ask if we had been pleased. Indeed we had. We will return to this wonderful restaurant and beautiful hotel.",2
5.0,CJ242,September 15 2013,9,"With guests who were visitng us from Vancouver, we were lucky enough to get reservations at Les Terrasses in Villa Florentine. Given the restaurant's great reputation, we were worried that we would be let down. We had exactly the opposite experience. Right from our arrival, the service was personal and welcoming. The food, each course was delicious. - not too big, not too small and certainly not heavy. There was a light use of sauce and each plate, each taste was perfectly balanced. Our wait staff was attentive and helpful but didn't hover. Their pacing was perfect. The tables were full and the atmosphere was elegant but not stuffy. We had a thoroughly enjoyable evening and would recommend this to anyone visitng Lyon who wants a memorable meal.",2
5.0,FredRE,September 5 2013,58,"On our way to the south of France we stayed one night at the fantastic hotel Villa Florentine on a package deal called ""Invitation gourmande"". This included a set menu called ""Aux saveurs ltaliennes"" at the one (Micheline) star restaurant at Villa Florentine; Les Terrasses de Lyon.  Unfortunately the weather wasn't at it's best the evening we dined at the restaurant, so the dining took place inside, instead of outside on the terrace. We never the less had an unforgettable evening in the pleasant ambience of the restaurant. The staff is very skilled, helpfull and attentive, and the sommelier did an excellent job, helping us select the perfect wines suitable to our taste, menu and wallet. We had an ""gastronomic overload"" this day, first having lunch at Paul Bocuse, and then having dinner at Les Terrasses de Lyon in the evening. It was very interesting to experience the different approach at these restaurants, with Paul Bocuse's overwhelming and excessive style, while Davy Tissot at Les Terrasses de Lyon showed an extremely elegant, detailed and refined approach in the ""Aux saveurs ltaliennes"" menu. In our view, the evening at Les Terrasses de Lyon was just as big a culinary experience as our lunch at Paul Bocuse. While enjoying our coffe and tea after dessert, Davy Tissot appeared at our table and we had a really pleasant chat with him. We found this to be a very nice touch. We have decided that we have to return to Villa Florentine and Les Terrasses de Lyon, and hopefully enjoy an evening outside on the terrasse with Davy Tissots's elegant creations - while enjoying the lovely view of Lyons old city.",2

5.0,Jolly B,July 3 2013,168,We went to Lyon basically for Paul Bocuse but dined here two nights earlier as the prelim. Although it is only 1 star Michelin it felt like a 3 star.

5.0,writerteacher001,June 17 2013,69,"We chose this restaurant for our special dinner on the rec of a friend who had been there. Yes, it is expensive. To give some idea --the ""fixed price menu"" is around a hundred Euros. There are little extras no matter what you order, like a small cold soup to start or petite fours to end. But with each course I found myself admitting you have to eat at a restaurant like this to get the kind of flavor and care involved. In comparison everything else we ate in Lyon was not even close to being in the same league. The presentations were works of art and the food was excellent. The sauces were nuanced and light. The wine list---which can be viewed online--- has bottles from 45 E up to over 3,000 E, with ""average"" being several hundred E, but one can order more reasonable flights and taste several.The sommelier was a very personable and informed young man who appeared to enjoy his job and was quick to smile. He is a gem and I trust they know that.   All of the service was excellent our evening. This is a place where one lingers and no one is rushing you out because they do not ""turn the tables"" from what we saw. At the end of the evening the chef came out as we left to greet us, which was a nice touch. Also unexpected, especially since we hardly broke the bank. However, I suspect the staff could tell that we were very appreciative of the chef's efforts.   Now, as for the dress ""code."" There does not appear to be one. The place was full and I believe most of the patrons were French, but aside from one table with men in dark suits and white shirts (the business uniform in Lyon) the dress was casual. Very casual in some cases. I counted three men in jeans and sport shirts, and one of them wore sneakers. Most men did not wear ties or jackets. My husband, in his sport coat and tie, was hardly underdressed. No bling on the women, who as usual appeared more attentive to their dress then the men but hardly dressed to the nines. I have no idea if it is more dressy on weekends (we were there during the week.)   I have no idea how they assign tables. We were on the terrace, in front, but then we were one of the first there and they knew it was a special occasion.  Be aware that getting to this place is difficult. Take a taxi. You can call for one,and considering what you are going to pay for dinner the cost is negligible. Do not try to do the metro (you would have to take the funicular all the way up the hill, then walk down steep roads) or the stairs (you would end up climbng half the way up that big hill behind the Old Town.)",2

But after the cheese, when we were ready for check, for some reasons, nobody came by so we can ask for check. I was so tired after a day of sightseeing. I had to leave and let my friend waiting for bill. Our dinner started at 8PM. but when I got to my hotel, it was almost midnight. With some efficiency, the dinner could have ended at 11PM.  They did take care of the customer. One men sitting near the window was seemingly cold. They brought in a blanket for him, and even brought in a space heater for him.",2

5.0,KarenJSC,October 7 2012,46,"This gem of a restaurant is a long walk up the hill from the main square towards the beautiful cathedral. However the walk (or taxi fare) is so worth it. From the exterior it looks fine, but inside it is very impressive. The main lobby is what was originally the chapel in it's convent days. I was surprised how tastefully this has been done. The whole experience has a quality about it. The Hotel Manager gave us a brief hisory and his enthusiam was infectious. We ate with a party in a private room and the service and quality was exceptional. Plus, don't miss the view from the terrace at night time.",2
5.0,B-RReviews,August 19 2012,49,"It's not that we try to collect Michelin Stars when travelling, but when in Lyon it would've seemed odd not to eat here, just up the hill from where we were staying, and extend our enjoyment of what the city was offering by way of good food. Villa Florentine is a luxury hotel and its restaurant, Les Terrasses de Lyon, has one star. Perhaps more importantly for the diner, it has a spectacular view and as the sun set there was a constantly changing panorama, sun glinting off spires and towers, distant hills becoming clearer. Our meal and enjoyment of the view began with a coupe de champagne at the pool side, before moving into the restaurant area. Book your table for earlier rather than later; tables with views disappear in time with the setting sun.  We chose the 'Au plaisir des sens' menu, and asked the sommellier to select appropriate wines - he brought three excellent glasses. By a quirk of serving we got two portions of the amuse bouche - no complaint as they were delicious. The lobster had an intense flavour; I guess it had been gently poached in a stock of the shell. Everything on our plates John Dory, lamb, chocolate fondant - was beautiful to look at, and taste, and complemented the changing landscape in the distance. We asked for a cheese plate to share and had some fun with the waiter selecting a few - and the choice of wine to accompany them was amazing! It was getting chilly during dessert so we asked to move inside for our decaff coffee and petit fours: it was a vertitable cafe gourmand! Chef Davy Tissot was lingering in the dining room - it was the end of service - so we had a chat with him: what makes a Michelin starred restaurant, we asked? 'Hard work, good produce ... and this is what I do"" he replied. Any chef with ambition and pride would want to say the same though he spoke with humility and the satisfaction of doing a good job, every night.  Food, surroundings, service and wine of this quality entails spending money. People will ask if it's worth it: it's only worth it if you really enjoy it - and we did.",2
5.0,LeDude13,August 13 2012,250,"Stayed at the hotel for a romantic getaway and decided last minute to have dinner at this rather well known establishment in the Lyon area. Patrons of the hotel generally have a better chance of getting a table at the last minute than others.....and the best tables need to usually be booked a couple of weeks in advance in summer. Bumped into the Chef Davy Tissot (Meilleur Ouvrier de France) by the pool area and asked if wearing flip flops to dinner was ok with him....he smiled and nicely said 'no'....that kind of irritated me....but this is France and this is a fine dining establishment....my American side needed to chill out. When in France, remember to dress up a bit more at the swanky joints...that said, I had to smile when I saw the way some of the patrons were dressed...not exactly Monte Carlo. Chef Tissot and his brigade have a tightly organized menu that is French with some Italian flourishes...and though we stayed with the French dishes, the 'mise en appetit' had a taste of the risotto which was absolutely delicious. We opted to go a la carte rather than the tempting discovery menus and we were not disappointed. Be it the foie gras poelee or the quenelle with ecrevisse our first course had us both savoring each bite. My second course was Limousin veal (the butcher is also a Meilleur Ouvrier de France)- cooked to perfection with 'petits legumes' and a sauce that were just stellar while my girlfriend enjoyed a John Dory. With a passionate and well informed sommelier we made a terrific oenological discovery and finished by sharing a single cheese plate and desert. A wonderful meal and between the location, view and what Chef Tissot and his brigade deliver (though we heard him getting loud in the kitchen at one point....he apparently has a temper...reminded me of a Gordon Ramsey scene that must have been unfolding in the kitchen), I wouldn't be surprised to find that this place acquires it's second star soon. Warmly recommended to all those who share in the motto 'Life is short, eat well.'",2

5.0,Corbin C,September 14 2011,5,"We booked at Florentine because it was repeatedly referred to as one of the two best hotels in old Lyon. Additionally, it was on a small mountain or large hill accessible by foot up four stories off stairs or by taxi. The stairs we took to get in shape and the taxi's we took at night.  The place has a humble but welcoming lobby with rooms above and a Michelin starred restaurant below. The desk is staffed by reserved young staff who are multilingual and who have worked around Europe. As we opened up to them over a few days, they felt comfortable opening up and sharing with us. We respected them tremendously. Our room was the most spacious that we have stayed in during European travel. Fabulous views of Lyon with the expected windows that swing open for breezes, large comfortable beds and good storage space. We were thrilled with the push button drapes opener. A very large screen HD TV with English and French channels allowed us to keep up with the news as did the free International Tribune at the desk. A beautiful outdoor was visible from our room but we did not have time to use it. We enjoyed two meals at the Michelin restaurant and enjoyed them as much or more than our high end experiences in Paris. Fabulous food, expert and attentive service, with a we are willing to do anything to make you comfortable and happy. I loved it so much that I would return in a New York minute if I had the time.",2
3.0,Sharyn E,August 26 2011,19,"That is exactly how my husband and I felt after stopping in for a drink and a snack . . with an amazing view, yesterday afternoon at Les Terrasses de Lyon at the Villa Florentine.  We had been walking for hours and while we worked up quite a sweat (the temp was in the high 80's) we also worked up quite an appetite. I had heard wonderful things about this beautiful hotel and tasty restaurant. Unfortunately they were not nearly as happy to see us as we were to see them. We got the snub face when we said we didn't have a reservation (mind you the restaurant was not even full) but were eventually shown to a table. .. with a view of a plant . . .the only table with a crappy view on the entire terrace. Here's to hoping the food was going to be better than the attitude. Long story short. . . from menus, to bottles of watter, to the wine list, to the check, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, had to be asked for more than once (unless of course they just don't respond to inquiries from women. . .since they did have ""ladies menus"" without prices on them). In addition, we got looks ranging from disgust, to disdain to just plain annoyance throughout our meal (although I did manage to get one of the 6 or 7 wait staff working the room to actually smile a few times, once he realized how much we were enjoying our food.) We each started with a glass of champagne and decided to order a plate of the foie gras and a cheese plate to share (you would bot believe the cheese cart. . .) instead of a full multi course lunch.  Service was rather slow so we ordered a bottle of Chinon ""La Croix Boissee"" 2008 Bernad Baudry. . .good choice Mike and with no help from a sommelier (who never even showed his or her face, even though the wine list looked bigger than the bible!!) But here is the surprise, food we never ordered started coming out. Turns out even when you don't order the prix fix lunch, the two amuse bouches they serve are also yours to taste as well. And let me tell you..they sure were tasty. We started to get nervous thinking..oh god, what are they going to charge us for this stuff we never even ordered. The foie gras was warm and succulent. . .like something I have never tasted before. And the cheese . . we got a tasting of 10 DIFFERENT cheeses. We are still talking about them Since service was so slow, we decided to each get a glass of dessert wine ..a tasty Moscato d'Asti for me and a Poire Granit Eric Bordelet for Mike to accompany our cheese course. We were pleasantly surprised when the bill finally did eventually arrive (there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant when we were done) to find out that all the other tasty treats were not on the bill and we were only charged for one cheese plate. . .all that cheese for just 15 euros?? That was a good value for sure. All said and done, the food was amazing and not too shabby price wise (but then again, we didn't even have a full meal) but I have to say that the service, the nasty vibe and attitude towards us. .not sure if it was because we were not staying at the hotel, didn't have reservations or were not dressed in our finest, are reason enough to think twice about going back to the restaurant again, let alone stay at the hotel. Go at your own risk...or if you have a very thick skin!!!",2
1.0,AmarGeti,May 12 2011,149,"Disappointing service and the worst welcoming ever, in a gastronomic 1-star Michelin restaurant  My husband and I drove from Brussels to Lyon for a romantic weekend. We were looking forward to dining at Les Terrasses de Lyon, where we had booked a table 11 days earlier, via the restaurant's internet site. Being regular customers in some of France's most prominent restaurants, we arrived at Les Terrasses de Lyon with some basic expectations. Being the first ones to arrive, we did not expect much of an 'ambiance'. Indeed, the restaurant was quiet – however, not even some soft background music could be heard. We were escorted to our table, which was placed outside the kitchen, far, far away from the windows, from where one could marvel at the city lights. At my remark (in French) that the table did not enjoy any nice view, the maitre replied a plain 'no' and left. That signalled the start of a strange kind of service and left us feeling as if we had just taken a cold shower. The rest of the service continued in that fashion, with staff not even smiling. All the other guests who arrived afterwards were taken to the tables by the windows. Another couple who was given a table next to us also asked for a table by the windows but also received the same cold reply. Overall, some distinction in the service was evidently felt. The tempo of the service is fine and the quality of the cuisine is good – except for a surprisingly very salty risotto. But the service made all the bad difference: it is unacceptable in such a restaurant that the waiter brings a plate and walks away without collecting empty wine glasses or empty soda bottles. When a waiter passed with bread rolls he suggested 4 different types. When he passed again he suggested only 3. When I asked where the 4th option for a bread roll went, he said that there were only 3 options. At the end of the meal the waiter passed with the cheese trolley but could not explain if cheese was included in the menu we had ordered or not. What was also remarkable is the fact that staff were walking too quickly between tables without any elegance. In her haste one waitress almost turned over the petits fours that came with the coffee and had to return with a new plate. At the end of the meal, when we asked for the bill, the Maitre was all smiles and even managed to utter a few words, asking if we had enjoyed our meal! When we asked why were not given a table with view, he said that guests usually ask for a table with a view when booking – but this was not mentioned anywhere as an option when we did the booking on line. Why do people go to gastronomic restaurants if not to enjoy excellent food in a pleasant surrounding and get a little pampered? In Les Terrasses de Lyon, this combination was not possible.",2
