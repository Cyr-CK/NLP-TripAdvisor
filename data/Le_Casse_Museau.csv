5.0,MittyMitty,September 10 2021,29,"The restaurant's ambience is stunning. Small, cozy, giving you the feeling that the clock has turned back to a quainter time. The food is absolutely delicious in every aspect. We began with an aperitif before enjoying the amazing set course meal that we could actually watch Chef Alex cooking. Our host, Fred, was delightful and made us feel like we were dining in someone's home. We were only in Lyon for one night and I'm so glad we had the opportunity to dine here.",6
5.0,David F,October 21 2021,5,"We loved this restaurant ... excellent traditional French food, menu even presented on chalkboards, in an exquisite, intimate setting. The owner himself serves the food in a friendly, warm, helpful manner. We came here for my 60th birthday, and I can't imagine celebrating this milestone occasion in a more wonderful way.",6
4.0,Ian F,October 23 2022,66,"A beautiful and charming restaurant with warm staff is what got this 4 stars. Unfortunately, my wife and I both found the food bland, including the dish the restaurant is best known for. Maybe it was an off night. If we lived there we‚Äôd probably give it another chance but it was a bit of a disappointment.",6
5.0,cybrmoon,September 18 2024,383,"It was during a day trip between Fontainebleau and Villeurbanne that we had dinner at the Casse-Museau with the family on August 30, 2024. Adapts good tables like him, I had let my eldest son choose the establishment by setting only one watchword: home cooking in a friendly place. Indeed, the ""contract"" has been fulfilled. Whether it was quenelle, veal andouillette or sweetbread, everything was perfect and tasty. Special mention for the filling, a dolphin gratin that remains in my memory. Prices for wines by the glass are correct, the choice is simple but fits perfectly with the cuisine offered. But beyond the gastronomic aspect, I want to emphasize the quality of service, the friendliness of the staff and the sense of welcome of Eric. No doubt, this gourmet stopover will be a landmark. As an indication, an addition to 170 ‚Ç¨ to four (drinks, dishes, desserts). AR Fontainebleau-Lyon",6
5.0,Petrouss,July 27 2024,5,"Setting and atmosphere typical of a Lyonnais cork, we were able to discover Lyonnais specialties of excellent qualities and very well cooked and homemade The staff is smiling, pleasant welcoming and cheerful even for people who come from far away.... who ask for things that are not on the menu as an aperitif with a little surprise at the end of the dish for the best üòâ The staff is also kind by offering to take the elevator for people having trouble climbing stairs and eating upstairs Finally in short an address to put on the program of visit and keep to return without hesitation",6
5.0,Flo,January 9 2024,276,"Great new find to eat at a traditional Bouchon Lyonnais, offering iconic recipes in a cosy restaurant. 34 euros for 3 courses is a good price. The main waiter is very special and will look after you, he has a great sense of humour. Lovely Lyonnaise salad and local tasty bread, just the right size plate to make room for the wonderfully tasty garlic chicken with its scrumptious Gratin Dauphinois. One of the best! Reminds you of your grandmother's cooking (if you are French) :) I recommend the creme caramel for dessert, smooth, deep and generous size. I will come back to try the quenelles.",6
5.0,GG,November 24 2024,32,"The team really knows how to make guests feel comfortable and create a warm atmosphere. The dishes are a tribute to tradition. Each bite is filled with flavors, impossible not to finish your plate by sucking. Each dish evokes childhood memories, as if we were rediscovering the tastes of our family meals. Even the plates, with their retro charm, add a touch of nostalgia, and everything here seems to tell a story. It is an experience that blends taste, memory and conviviality, all in a pleasant and authentic atmosphere. We will be back with great pleasure!",6
5.0,Jeremy G,April 7 2024,23,"As soon as we arrived at Casse Museau, the warm atmosphere and smiling welcome immediately won us over. The chef's terrine, a starter that promised simplicity and authenticity, exceeded our expectations with its perfect texture and rustic flavors. But the real tour de force was the sweetbreads with morels ‚Äì a dish of absolute finesse, where the controlled cooking revealed an almost bewitching taste. My partner, for her part, was delighted by the generosity of the Lyonnaise salad, a local classic brilliantly revisited. His pike quenelle, majestic in its traditional cassolette, lived up to the reputation of the house. We would like to thank the chef and his team for enhancing these precious moments spent at their table. Each bite was a celebration of the Lyon terroir. The only downside to our experience was a small oversight ‚Äì the birthday candle for my darling, despite a reservation made three weeks in advance. However, this incident cannot tarnish the splendor of our evening, as the quality of the food and the attentive service left an impression on us. 4.5/5 ‚Äì A must in Lyon for gourmets looking for authenticity, with a small margin for perfection!",6
5.0,Pauline D,November 21 2023,3,"Eric, thank you for this moment full of conviviality where we not only taste your dishes (which were delicious) but where we also have the impression of being part of your loved ones and where we feel like the House. A pure moment of happiness, in all simplicity. A big thank-you!",6
5.0,Lucien B,January 7 2024,1,"Group of senior singers, we had our annual meal in this establishment, The decor is typical of Lyonnais corks. The welcome by the owner was friendly and extremely friendly, epicureans by nature we appreciated the cuisine of the place and its very good Beaujolais. The climate of the evening ""forced"" us to sing a song (by the monks of St Bernardins) which was appreciated by the other guests present in the restaurant. In conclusion, we recommend the place and will not fail to make a second visit. Sincerely",6
5.0,PatanChuck,October 9 2023,18,We so enjoyed this Bouchon! We sat upstairs and had a lovely Lyonnaise cuisine - quenelles were delicious as well as my husbands chicken dish. Atmosphere had a lot of buzz and we also enjoyed the old French classics playing in the background.  Service was spot on - just wish I could remember his name as he was very personable with and very helpful in our selections.,6
5.0,Daniel-Henry R,December 6 2024,2,"We had lunch at this friendly restaurant on my birthday, December 4th exactly. I won't say the number, but it's high. The welcome was warm, up to the standard and even more, the many comments we had read here. Having ordered a glass of Viognier, I particularly appreciated that Eric, the boss, presented me with the bottle and served me my glass at the table. Attention is scarce enough to be emphasized. In addition, this wine was excellent and I even ordered a second one! As for dishes, no surprise: eggs, salad Lyonise, quenelle and chicken garlic feasted us. Special mention for dessert: the praline pie with its scoop of vanilla ice cream is really delicious. Delicate attention: dessert was accompanied by a small glass of digestive in honor of my birthday. Thanks Eric, we'll be back. Signed: Jeannine and Daniel",6
5.0,Ingrid J,January 26 2024,1,"Wonderful little Lyonnais cork! From beginning to end ! A superb, really warm welcome, a great evening with friends, a little old-fashioned Lyonnais decor as we like it, but that's not everything... then the icing on the cake... we had a FUN!! Just magnificent Lyonnaise salad! Fine terrine and excellent onion compote! After andouillette for my very tasty friend of sublime finesse and me, veal sweetbreads with morel mushrooms, I'm still salivating! The best I have eaten! Accompanied by a delicious and delicious gratin dauphinois! It's rare that I go back to the same place but thanks for this discovery I will come back with my darling!",6
1.0,Tommaso C,November 15 2024,1,"We had the misfortune of even attempting to dine at CASSE MUSEAU. Despite booking in advance, we were turned away at the door simply because our reservation supposedly didn‚Äôt include a phone number. Completely unacceptable! We had a hungry 6-year-old child with us, yet the staff showed no empathy or understanding. The worst part was the owner‚Äôs disgraceful behavior. As we tried to explain the situation, he arrogantly said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, I am the boss, bye bye,‚Äù before dismissing us entirely. We were left completely shocked by his rudeness and lack of basic human decency. We never even got the chance to sit down, let alone eat, because of how horribly we were treated upon arrival. This place is run by disgusting individuals who clearly have no clue how to treat potential customers. Save your time, money, and dignity‚Äîgo somewhere else where you‚Äôll be treated with respect.",6
5.0,Philippe C,September 22 2024,31,"We were looking to discover the ‚Äúplug‚Äù spirit and we chose the muzzle breaker on its reputation here. We were not disappointed. Commercial welcome, but warm, attentive and never intrusive. A limited choice card, proving once again that it is the best path to quality. Perfect andouillette, tasty, gratin dauphinois that melts in the mouth... A little more expensive than others, but it remains reasonable and especially deserved",6
5.0,jia l,April 1 2024,4,"Very fun team. The waiters are fun and fast. The food is delicious. Love my first meal in Lyon. As an Oriental, I was quite nervous. The language barrier caused dining difficulties. I didn‚Äôt try to cancel the dessert because the main meal was too rich. I happily agreed immediately. Thank you for meeting me.",6
5.0,Pureplayer,November 7 2024,59,"We dined on Thursday, November 6 in this Lyon stopper downtown. We enjoyed the warm welcome , the humor of the boss and the table with simple but tasty dishes.  This establishment is especially true for its authentic atmosphere , cheerful and the quality of a particularly attentive service. There was a birthday party that night with a little noisy band but the boss was kind enough to change us tables for dessert to find a less exposed alcove. Now, friendliness is in order here. It is prudent to book because the restaurant has only 42 seats and the address is searched.",6
5.0,Pim,January 12 2024,7,"A warm welcome, inventive service and authentic cuisine. We chose emblematic dishes of homemade Lyonnaise cuisine: meurette eggs, calf's head and quenelle but also sweetbreads with morels, all washed down with a white Macon recommended by the boss. We enjoyed ourselves (special note for the sweetbreads) and had a great time. The upstairs room is decorated with great taste in a very ‚ÄúLyonnaise‚Äù atmosphere. We will come back with pleasure during our next trip to Lyon.",6
4.0,Zigett,May 30 2023,1207,"Long established traditional restaurant serving Lyonnaise dishes from a small menu. The pike quenelles were good but lacking flavour we thought. However, the sweetbreads with morels were excellent. They have a good selection of reasonably priced wines too.",6
5.0,wendymika,September 12 2024,49,"Traditional cuisine at will, very tasty. French atmosphere with 1 chic dishes embellished with 1 French variety sound background. We enjoyed ourselves and had a great time with Eric and his team. Aunt Paulette's restaurant is My Saves.",6
5.0,Gary H,September 30 2023,159,Booked based on previous reviews and we were not disappointed. Traditional setting centrally located. Great service from Eric and the team and fabulous food.

5.0,C C,August 7 2024,1,"This is a cozy place set in what appears to be an old residence. We went up a spiral staircase and were seated at a window overlooking the cobblestone street. The food was delicious and service was friendly. By the time we left, we felt like part of the family. For those worried about the ""weirdness"" of bouchon food, this place offers exotic but also approachable choices for those less adventurous.",6
5.0,Laurent L,October 6 2024,2,"I would have liked to give a Rating above 5 because the dinner was excellent. A real farandole of delights for our palates with the eggs, the terrine of the house, the quenelles and this famous chicken with garlic accompanied by its gratin dauphinois...

The menu is small and easy to understand. If you like hearty food, you'll definitely find the right menu for you. I had the sirloin steak with potato gratin. I could have bathed in the gratin! Best gratin ever. And the caramel cream that I had for dessert, mmm. It's worth stopping by le casse museau!",6

C√¥te de veau was cooked to pink perfection and served with the most amazing potatoes Anna. Saint-Jacques scallops were served with creamy risotto - marvelous. Starters were both showcases for mushrooms - a small but generous p√¥el√©e and a starter of poached eggs with morel sauce. A deconstructed baba au rhum was a lovely light dessert. All three staff members spoke English and were quite personable. Small but well chosen selection of wines.",6
