4.0,spomer,March 22 2022,18,"It's a butcher with a dining area. Very nice concept and a very nice selection of dry aged meats. They come with you to the aging fridge and explain to you the differences between the meats and cuts . You can also choose a degustation of different pieces if you are a few people, that way you can sample meat from spain, france, switzerland, wagyu and many more. They also have a nice selection of wines to accompany their meals and great service by competent people. The ""restaurant"" is quite small and extremely popular so you must reserve to make sure that you can have a place to eat. It's not easy also to finally get a hold of them in order to make that reservation. You get to taste the actual meat since it's not served with sauces, you get it the juice that it was cooked in.  Very nice meal and cool concept.",72
5.0,Roucairol,August 5 2023,270,"Restaurant specializing in meat, we have wanted to discover it for a while. By booking early enough we were able to get a table for dinner. And there it was a great moment of happiness, because from the starters (the sweets, the Bellota, the p√¢t√©s en croute) to the dishes (onglet, tartare, steak, walnuts) everything is delicious and above all cooked to order, blue or at point. As an accompaniment we were able to taste the pan-fried porcini mushrooms and fried potatoes. And finally the desserts enhanced this moment. The wine list is consistent with the region and the products, is very complete and for all budgets. To discover, and for us the teenagers have already planned to come back. ;))",72
5.0,Mathieu-cm,April 16 2024,18,"A great time and a real haunt for lovers of high quality meat. The formula at +15‚Ç¨ per person and being able to choose your own cuts of meat in the window is a real experience for any meat lover and having explanations when choosing is a huge plus. Special mention also to Nad√®ge who served us with a smile and incredible efficiency, something that we don't emphasize enough in these times when the service in restaurants is getting worse and worse and can make you have a very good evening. to excellent or average. So thank you Nad√®ge for giving us an excellent evening. Thanks to the chef for cooking the meats and their quality. A very good moment which will be reproduced. Ps: only small point to note, in our opinion it is essential to send the ribs in 2 batches. We noted that in general they are sent all 6 at the same time (but a friend told us that it was cold at the end even if we were offered to reheat), but it is not necessarily pleasant to have everything at the same time on the table and eat cold at the end (the 3rd being lukewarm when we ate it). So we really appreciated having had them in 2 installments. THANKS",72
5.0,Fred M,January 6 2024,79,"L'Argot has the best steaks and meat dishes in all of Lyon. The restaurant is lively and loud, and everyone seems to have a good time dining. The restaurant is also a butcher shop so the meats are freshly cut and on display. Service is professional and food comes fast. The pate en croute (two types) are also best in Lyon. The wine list is complete and full of affordable Rhone wines. I recommend you have a reservation or you will not be seated due to the popularity of the restaurant. I will most definitely return.",72
5.0,riche m,October 25 2023,2,"concept of the butcher's restaurant. There was a place of this type in La Croix-Rousse about twenty years ago but it was above all a butcher's shop. Nice range of over-ripe meats that you can choose from. Billing by weight. NO or few vegetables (we had to settle for carbo hash browns). Wine list in my opinion oversized. Expensive. 40EUROS A 250G TAB but it's wagiu beef! Vegetarians refrain, the salad is extra. In summer, the many local bistros set up terraces on platforms which extend widely onto the street and reduce parking spaces. It is not easy to park in the area. Very good restaurant but for carnivores.",72
5.0,Marie P,August 29 2024,2,"When you come to eat slang, you come mainly for the atmosphere. This time we had the chance to be placed near the butcher chef, who cuts, weighs, cuts, pampers his meat. Very nice atmosphere. A star is reserved for toilets: a flawless, top decoration, clean places. 2 stars for the meal: our children love, and it was my daughter‚Äôs birthday present, she asked for it!! Cooking is perfectly mastered, the Butter Butter Inn is perfect. Nothing was left on the plates. A star for service: smile and careful attention. My daughter even got her picture with the chef! She was so happy! Thank you!! And a star for Award Value: good meat is expensive but it is good and beautiful. We don't do this every day, but we do it when we have something to celebrate! It is a deserved 5/5!! Warning however: Reservation essential and very in advance for the evening!!!",72
1.0,Trek735082,July 14 2024,3,"We were visiting from the US, and made reservations weeks in advance. We do not speak French, but always make an attempt to use a few basic words. The staff made no effort to try to explain the menu or the process. The menu is only available in French, while most other restaurants had some option available for English interpretation. It was quite clear we did not get the same level of service. All others were taken to counter to select their steak, we were not. The steaks were much more well done than medium rare, as ordered. We were served quickly and out in under an hour. In was not a nice experience. We felt as if we should not be there. Unless you speak fluid French, I would steer clear.",72
5.0,albert d,June 8 2024,5,"A caboulot not bitten by cockchafers! We ate some tender and tasty pork, washed down with a good bit of picrate. The boss is not too greedy when it comes to artiche and the lunatics are nice. I'll make it short: this is where you have to be stingy to be Peter the Underbelly!",72
5.0,Chiang Chai T,December 12 2024,2,"Despite not speaking French, I had a warm reception when I entered. Though the restaurant was busy, I received good service. I managed to order my beef from their special chiller. I had the bone marrow for appetizer and they lit a fire on the bone for the added effect. The Rubia Gallega entrec√¥te was perfectly done at medium rare. My son and I were so full we were rolling out very satisfied. I will definitely come back again when I visit Lyon.",72
5.0,GUY F,February 9 2024,206,"Want some really good meat? I chose this place where we shared a beautiful rib of beef accompanied by tender potatoes and mushrooms. The cooking was as requested. Very good wine perfectly suited to our platter of well-sliced meat. What more can I say except come back to taste other meats from the window. Discreet staff, efficient service.",72
5.0,Magali,March 27 2024,11,"Fabulous experience! As a starter to share, a trio of crusty p√¢t√©s that are worth the detour! Meat dishes: generous, perfectly cooked, without fuss. And the desserts: top notch! I obviously recommend this restaurant to all lovers of very good meat. And to make matters worse, the bread was very good, and the tea was perfect. Attentive service with a smile!",72
5.0,69catherine69,August 8 2023,3,"Succulent meat, impeccable cooking. Accompany with a Beaune 1er Cru a jewel The lost brioche a delight The only downside is that the tables are a little too close, but great service, the boss, and a friendly atmosphere compensate for that. Successful, it was a magnificent moment An address not to be missed",72
2.0,Eric S,June 26 2024,1,"I don't like writing poor reviews, but I also have to be honest. We chose this restaurant after reading many reviews and to celebrate our steak-loving son's birthday. We were were left disappointed -- with both the food and the service. As soon as we sat down, we felt rushed to order. At no point did anyone explain the menu, or even try. They just kept sending different servers over to ask if we could order. Also, at no point did any of these servers invite us to look at the different cuts of meat -- something we watched them do for practically every other table. Was it because we were native English speakers (yes, we do our best to order in French)? I don't know. But the restaurant certainly made us feel like the intention was to ""flip"" our table as soon as they could. We ordered a charcuterie to start, then ribeyes. The steaks were delivered, along with burned potatoes, not even five minutes after the starter, leaving us no choice but to push the starter away if we wanted our steak hot. We should have kept the starter -- the steak was chewy and under-seasoned, especially for the price. Did we expect too much? Should we have asked to see the cuts? Did we order wrong, something lost in translation? All of these are possible. Still, given the reviews, we expected a lot more from this restaurant.",72

5.0,Brad-2732,October 29 2017,20,"Impressive! I never taste such a good meat before. It was so good that we decided to order a piece of wagyu after a first set of charcuterie and entrec√¥te. Unreasonable, but so good! I love this place. I think we ll go there again when we ll go south (to try the salers).",72
3.0,Sebastian m,July 28 2017,4,"A one-off, top quality restaurant for a reasonable price. On the downside, we had to wait for 20mins before somebody even came up to our table to order drinks. Just as we were about to stand up and leave it finally happened. Also take note that it quickly becomes very, very noisy inside. Would suggest to not go during busy times. And don't expect any salads :-)",72

3.0,A M A,October 13 2016,109,"I think the prices and wine list is ok but the mear was not really served hot rather warm. With mostly lots of fat in it I dont like this at a steakhouse. The cooking also was not really very good, ƒ± think the need a master on top of the grill.",72

5.0,VFM55,July 12 2016,170,"My wife and I called in and made a reservation for dinner last Friday evening whilst we were in Lyon for a long weekend. The fact that on arrival we were greeted by name and the usual Gallic kiss got us off to a flying start. We would advise ringing or calling in as many people were turned away, the place was full to the rafters when we finished. This is quite simply a meat eaters paradise with cuts that we are all familiar with up to those we may have only read about. The chefs sharing platter as a starter would on some days be enough for a meal. My wife chose the onglet and I had a ""coeur de sirloin"", both were up there amongst the best flavoured and cooked meat we have ever had. Perhaps, just the tiniest of disappointments, the accompaniment was macaroni cheese. Now there are only two things I just cannot eat that is one and the other is banana. Luckily macaroni cheese is my wife's favourite, so she was in double heaven. Pot de vin rouge very good. We would go out of our way to eat here again.",72

3.0,Richard L,June 21 2016,131,"If you love meat this is the place I had the rib eye which was a beautifully presented and perfectly cooked steak, with exceptional flavor. This is a very small and very happening place. The service and ambiance are outstanding",72
5.0,Joseph S,March 12 2016,37,"Dinning at L Argot was a delight! A walk-in butchery by day and an Meat restaurant at night with an gorgeous mouth watering meat display behind you! Starting with a Trio of Terrine: terrine Pote au feu, terrine de foi gras, veau et pistache, et la terrine compagnard (cochon). A great invitation to dive in the meat world. Main course: Filet d'agneau du Limousin, was extremely tender, cooked to perfect by the butcher-chef. Ending your night with a delicious Mont blanc or Omlette Norvegienne ""flambee devant vous"". Tres bonne acceuil, charmant et energetique serveuse, tout pour passer une excellente soiree!",72
5.0,Ian T,February 24 2016,9,"Seriously - this place has a lot to live up to. You don't climb to the top of TripAdvisor for no reason. I have been here on 2 occasions now and it has never failed to impress. A butchery for the week and restaurant for a few days - this place knows it's meat and really knows how to cook it. Caring and friendly waiting staff, a butcher with a great sense of humour and a brilliant chef. The place is small and demand is high - booking is essential and well in advance! If you like steak and dauphinois potatoes, you will not be disappointed! The wine choice was also good, as were the delicious desserts. Overall - really good value and very high quality food.",72
4.0,mdawkins747,January 11 2016,84,From the very warm welcome we knew this was an evening to be remembered. The freshly cut pata negra was our shared meat started followed by French fillet of beef cooked exactly as requested. . Then a duo of great strong cheeses and home prepared profiteroles. No pretence this is a butcherie with a chef to cook what you choose. One small warning though. No vegetables in sight and our meat was flooded in butter. Very French but we would have much proffered olive oil or nothing.. go here for the meat experience..,72
3.0,Gary3101984,January 10 2016,256,"We went to this place after seeing the reviews on ta. It is really expensive for the meat, they recommend us to have 1.5 kg of beef between 2 of us, the food is quite greasy with all the butter it is cooked in. The house wine is a lot more expensive than other places. The decor is impressive, the service is good.",72
5.0,Ferxel,December 30 2015,9,"First you feel welcomed as soon you enter in the restaurant. The butcher is working behind his table. You can feel the happiness they have and their proudness, you already know the food will be good. And it is ! For those who love meat, don't miss this place.",72

The minute you walk through the door, the welcome you get is amazing, the staff are so frendly and helpful and the atmosphere is buzzing. The selection and the quality of the beef is fantastic (as are the appetizers and side-dishes), the cooking of everything is top-notch and it's reasonably priced - even though we had a decent sized piece of Wagu in our order it was till only about 40‚Ç¨ a head (we skipped dessert as we were quite full). We immediately booked again so that we can bring our friends. Very highly recommended...",72

The food was simply awesome as was the service. The only downsides, which do not warrant any less stars, are: the red wine was chilled but it didn't take long for it to warm up and there was no wi-fi... yet (allegedly). Everything else was simply marvellous.",72
