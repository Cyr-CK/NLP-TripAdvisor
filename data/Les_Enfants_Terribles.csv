4.0,Turner S,October 11 2020,1496,It seemed like a very touristy street but we were happy to find so many restaurant options in one place. Lyon may be the gastronomic capital of Paris but it was surprisingly difficult to find restaurants outside of Vieux Lyon. The food was good and service friendly. They had all the traditional Lyon items on the menu. Lyon has good food but it is heavy. Throw in a bottle or wine and it‚Äôs straight to bed after. The tarte aux pralines here was a helpful sugar rush at the end. Enough to drag ourselves back to the hotel.,13
3.0,Nicnic,November 25 2024,137,"Unfortunately, the typical setting, the professionalism and the sympathy of the service (Robin I believe) are not enough to justify the price, or even authentic French cuisine.... A salad with 5 poultry livers, a slice of calf liver bathed in melted butter accompanied by a small ramekin of gratin dauphinois, a brain of Canu (a little cottage cheese with shallots and chives...) a beer and a pitcher of wine 80‚Ç¨????? Lyonnais, you have to come down from the stratosphere, huh? Capital of gastronomy? All restaurants serve the same thing and exaggerate on prices. But here we reach heights!",13
3.0,Lylou C,June 1 2024,2,"Upon arriving the server does not find the reservation made in April for yesterday, There were 8 of us, the 7 dishes arrived and the eighth did not arrive, we asked after 10 minutes for the missing dish but the only answer we got was ‚Äúit happens‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs because that there are 8 of you and there are 2 in the kitchen‚Äù without even apologizing. After 25 minutes of waiting the dish arrived and not even completely hot. They were still kind enough to make a commercial gesture for waiting for a dish while the others were served",13
5.0,Danny A,September 1 2023,41,"So many restaurants to choose from on this street but the menu here caught our eye. On returning at 7pm when they opened we were delighted with the welcome and were seated outside on the street seating which was ideal for watching the world wandering bye. The staff were well presented (compared to other staff in the street establishments who were in jeans & T-shirts) polite and efficient, making recomendations for chefs specials and locally produced wines. The food did not disappoint and the wine was exceptional. It was a slightly more expensive meal than normal but we were treating ourselves and our friend over from New Zealand and we did have the chef's special starter and the bottle of wine that was recommended. All in all it was a perfect end to a great day out in Lyon.",13
2.0,Rawad A,October 15 2022,2,"The reception was very bad. Moreover, after waiting 50 minutes, we asked for the food, the server almost insulted us and asked us why we are here if we are in a hury, and he started shouting! His colleague took the initiative and tried to resolve the situation. We received the food 1 hour late and not as per our requests. On the other hand, the food was good, however, it was a bad experience overall.",13
1.0,J√©r√¥me G,February 22 2024,1,"Very disappointed with our dishes!!! We ordered the burger for extra cooking, it is served raw tartare style!! The dish is returned to the kitchen for additional cooking. We wait 25 minutes but still nothing the rest of the family had finished eating We decide to leave, the burger is charged ‚Ç¨29.50 (on the site ‚Ç¨26.50!!!) even though I ate a quarter!!! A very unpleasant gentleman cashes us and tells us that half the burger has been eaten!!! No excuses!!!! To flee !!!",13
1.0,Hermilly Nicolas,November 1 2023,1,"An hour and fifteen minutes for my 6-year-old daughter to have a pasta gratin, and for my wife to have a bone-in-marrow starter, knowing that I was not served my hairy foie gras starter.... The condescending dirty chef doesn't listen to customers, and even worse, he blames his faults on the waitress who had done her job well. This is the first time I've left a restaurant without even having eaten, we left at the end of the starter. Result: 1 glass of wine, 1 fruit juice, a mixture of fruit juices, a pasta gratin and a bone marrow for ‚Ç¨42, without even a gesture or an apology. I go to restaurants 2 to 3 times a week and I have never seen so much condescension. There is no need to apologize on the site or even offer me a meal or discount, I would not change my rating or my comment.",13
1.0,OnTheMove2023,October 7 2023,24,"Service was terrible at Les Enfants Terribles on a Saturday night when we went. It should be called Le Restaurant Terrible instead. Staff were brusque (can live with that), bread never came to our table even after we asked (was delivered to other tables around us). Food took a very long time to arrive, one dish was delicious, two dishes decent, one dish was passable but with some items inedible and when we asked to change them we were told ‚Äúyou can order and pay for another dish‚Äù. Water was not replenished at all and never were able to order drinks other than the first round. Disappointing and would not recommend or return here. Many many other fabulous restaurants in Lyon that you can go to instead.",13
2.0,Ginger CS,September 29 2024,19,"This restaurant was recommended by a local when we were visiting Lyon. So, unfortunately, we took her word that it was good. Not even mediocre. Ordered the fish soup, thinking it would actually have some fish and (maybe) veggies in it, no. It was BROTH, completely liquid and of a taste I couldn't even describe nor eat for 18 Euro!! Entrees were edible only because we were starving. Service was non-existent even as French standards go. We had to wait and wait and wait just for water and bread while others who came in later were served before us. I think the first issue was that the waitstaff seemed very annoyed that we did not order any wine but only tap water. He asked 2 more times if we wanted wine (do they get a commission? who knows?) Plenty of restaurants in the area. I would definitely choose another over this one.",13
5.0,Romer,April 26 2024,246,What to say about this restaurant ü§© traditional cuisine with exceptional products prepared with attention and quality service. Well done and thank you very much. We had an excellent evening. Everything was perfect and extremely good that I didn't have time to take photos of the plates to share. Highly recommended. The best of Rue Mercier.,13
4.0,Curious446526,June 1 2023,224,"Strictly mediocre. Priced high for the area, the food was only so-so. Steak was undercooked and smothered. The potato dish was hot enough to melt human flesh, but not too bad once it cooled. Service was good, but rushed. Overall, I would have preferred something tastier elsewhere. The saving grace was the cute place and the outside tables in the beautiful Lyon weather.",13
3.0,Ang√©line G,September 17 2023,14,"The dishes were very good, nothing to complain about the cooking and the friendliness of the staff. However, even though all prices in general have increased, the prices here are high compared to the products offered. We had a pitcher of white wine which was not cold enough. Coming as a couple, we regretted the promiscuity of the restaurant since we found ourselves stuck to 2 other tables of 2 people. Finally, the atmosphere was a little too subdued and noisy, therefore not idyllic for a romantic meal.",13
5.0,Philippe C,September 20 2024,35,"Simply beautiful An exceptional pan-fried foie gras... The gambas were succulent and the sweetbread perfect. What to say... Little flat, we arrived early, around 7:30 p.m. and were quickly served Everything was perfect FOR US, but not the neighboring couple who arrived 45 minutes later and waited more than an hour.",13
4.0,Pathine,April 13 2024,16,"Back from the concert it‚Äôs 11:30 p.m., we go looking for a place to grab a bite to eat before going home. Very smiling welcome by a dynamic and pleasant team despite the late hour. Two tartares, a Lyonnais pot and a regional cheese later, we return delighted from our stop at Les Enfants Terribles, thank you!",13
3.0,Isabelle M,August 7 2023,16,"Good location, very busy street (Lyon traffic jams) for a Saturday evening Good dishes. Wines by the glass also. Very welcoming and available staff Downside on the knives = no fish knife for fish and especially not suitable for Black Angus sirloin steak. Please use a good meat knife for this quality of meat. Downside on the toilets: only 1 cramped dated, door a few millimeters from the door of the Smeg fridge....",13
1.0,Carla,December 1 2024,9,"Run away! When we go to the toilet we discover the kitchen, which cuts our appetite before we have eaten. Unkind staff who gut themselves in front of customers. Gratin of overcooked macaroni, inedible fries and excessively expensive prices! A catch tourists....",13
5.0,Mark68,September 13 2024,346,"Last minute dinner on cold rainy night.. quick seating. Fun menu‚Ä¶ great wine, mediocre gin & tonic‚Ä¶ salad nice size and veal was moist and tender.. great location on restaurant row!!!!quaint and cozy feel w lots on walls to browse around!!",13
5.0,boulineau,August 31 2024,4,Great on the plate and for the welcome. We ate very well monkfish with meat juice for my husband and sausage for me. Very hearty and good. The room manager is smiling and very nice. The waiter also we had a great evening. Come discover!!,13
5.0,Alexandra E,February 25 2024,329,We had a wonderful meal at this place. The beef steak with pepper sauce was excellent. The potatoes dauphinois no less then expected. The pork leg is also interesting. The prices are normal for this part of town. Very good!,13
5.0,Lecharlo,November 16 2024,14,5/5 for a disastrous service:) late booking and bad orders but Robin's great cuisine and good humor make up for it. Offered drinks and digestive with Robin after closing made us want to come back as soon as possible! Go ahead without hesitation!,13
5.0,Joycetraveller,September 7 2024,196,The waiter/manager Robin cares about the restaurant and your experience. I have severe allergies and he spoke with the chef as to what they could make me and then confirmed it when it was brought out !!. Both the prawns and the monkfish were specials and delicious .,13
5.0,Patty C,May 7 2024,40,"Chloe was our waiter, she was very attentive and gave us outstanding service on a very busy night!  The food was fabulous.",13
4.0,MAGGY STAVRIANAKI,December 15 2023,90,Great atmosphere and the food was also quite nice and delicious. The meals were a little bit smaller than usual but tasty. The staff was very friendly,13
5.0,SUE B,October 3 2023,25,Wonderful Lyonnais atmosphere and food! We were served fast and efficiently. A find on rue Merciere!,13
1.0,Culture589832,May 19 2023,2,Extreme disappointment. We came here to celebrate an 80th birthday. 2 people not served. One person waited 1 hour after the rest of the group had received their meals and finished.,13
1.0,Pjean73,December 15 2019,9,Don‚Äôt go there ! The reception was horrible. Humiliating! Honestly! The women almost insulted us because she saw we were looking at the menu of the restaurant which was side by side. At chocking experience. The price are expensive and the room is dark and small,13
5.0,czechyou,October 20 2019,150,"I loved this restaurant; excellent service and atmosphere, as well as delicious food and wine. Couldn‚Äôt ask for better! The steak was perfectly cooked and the morel mushroom sauce was divine. Service was friendly and warm. Would highly recommend and I would return in a heartbeat the next time I‚Äôm in Lyon.",13

5.0,John V,May 5 2019,21,We were recommended this restaurant by our waiter and the food service and wine were all good. We had a waiter who spoke good English which was good for us.,13
5.0,Christina N,May 2 2019,12,"Everything about the restaurant was enjoyable. From the relaxing outdoor seating on a busy pedestrian street, to the perfectly attentive waiter and a most delicious meal! We had the Lyonnaise salads which were a perfect balance of fresh crispy frisse. lardons and croutons with that buttery mouthfeel of poached egg on top! It was our last night in Lyon and I was determined to try as many classic dishes as possible so I had the Quenelles.What a delightful and satisfying seafood entree served piping hot! I opted for more wine as my dessert and enjoyed every drop.",13
5.0,Ang√®le R,February 3 2019,40,"I went to les Enfants Terribles right before the kitchen closed, and the staff kindly accepted me for my late lunch... I had a delicious gratin dauphinois and salad, and also an amazing tea and desert! The staff is very friendly and arranging, I would totally recommend this place!",13
5.0,Arlene L,September 12 2018,170,"This is a charming, traditional spot in the middle of a lively restaurant district.  We were delighted with our food and the friendly service. Prices were moderate.",13
3.0,Ian S,August 14 2018,365,"We walked up and down the cobbled street and decided to try this restaurant, wasn't very busy but looked inviting. The staff were very friendly, we a starter and tartares for the main course washed down with a glass of Crozes Hermitage. The tartares were very good, we had salmon and beef. Declined desserts as we had had enough to eat. Would recommend. The cost was very reasonable, good value for money.",13
3.0,MichelinTom,August 11 2018,414,"Front of house staff were excellent. Young, keen to help and had a good knowledge of English. However, the food was quite basic and saucing too heavy and the prices are much too high for the basic quality of ingredients and cooking.",13
4.0,Lorenzo M,April 7 2018,10,"We've been there on Thursday evening, without booking, 4 people. We ordered 4 appetizers, 4 main dishes, desserts and coff√©. Taste was good and quantities also. To ne suggested absolutely !!!",13

5.0,Keith D,March 19 2018,178,We had a great last night in here. Very busy but we got a great table. Inside it is exactly what we wanted/expected it to look like ! Food was great and the wine pots good value. Would definitely go back.,13
5.0,Ted42480,December 19 2017,147,"It‚Äôs a very nice place in the main restaurant street. This restaurant is well known in Lyon. The french charcuterie, the meat and the gratin dauphinois are wonderful. The staff is friendly and helpful. If you go to Lyon, you have to go here !!!",13
4.0,yns_10,November 5 2017,1446,We had dinner in this popular restaurant on a Thursday night in late October. The salads were okay as was the beef tartare. The highlight of the dinner was the fromage blanc for dessert and the good service from the charming waitress.,13
5.0,Christine D,October 18 2017,18,Thoroughly enjoyed pork ribs and lentils (ham and sausages in a lentil stew). Topped off with house white. Staff attentive and were happy to explain menu in English. Loved the room although plenty of guests ate outside.,13
4.0,Dancingqueen5050,October 7 2017,71,"Enfants terrible , we have the same restaurant name in Montreal and I was curious to go there. It was at the end of the evening for coffee and dessert. Really pleasant terrasse and lucky us...no smokers around!! Next visit to Lyon I will go for supper to really try their menu.",13
4.0,Betty L,October 5 2017,73,We enjoyed the Enfants Terribles burger but our friend chose the veal which was tough and the vegetables were not what he had ordered. We considered the burgers to be excellent and different and would visit again. The seating was cramped and rather uncomfortable.,13
5.0,TheRez,September 18 2017,72,"Recommended by our hotel, we went along for dinner. Exceptional. Charles and Alex looked after us and were superb.. Food amazing. Wine too. We shall be back!",13
4.0,Valentina R,August 30 2017,18,"We were in Lyon last week and we decided to eat in the very characteristic restaurant (they call them 'bouchon') and try some typical food from around here. My parents were enthusiastic about their quenelles and I loved them too! The desserts were amazing and completely homemade. The staff (every single one of the three guys who served us) was friendly and laughed a lot with us, explaining some of the food we didn't know, and all around very helpful. Lovely experience, I would choose them again!",13
5.0,PugsleyJ,August 6 2017,34,"On a sunny Sunday we managed to get a table on the terrace at the most attractive 'Les Enfants Terribles' restaurant in Lyon. On such a busy day we were shown to our table promptly with menu, water and bread brought immediately by a friendly and most professional waiter. He then explained to us the menu in English (as new residents to Lyon our French is still very basic). We chose from the daily 3 course menu and the food was well presented and tasted delicious. The star dish was a white truffle ravioli... truly amazing and a perfect balance of flavour and texture. With a glass of wine or two and espresso the bill for two came to 61 euros. A steal for such wonderful food and service.",13
5.0,Maureen R,July 9 2017,50,"First night in Lyon and we decided to eat here. Partner had fish soup which was excellent, and then we both had the veal. Beautiful sauce accompanied the dish. Friendly service. Would recommend.",13
4.0,David Hallett,July 3 2017,1037,"This restaurant is situated on Rue Merciere amongst lots of other restaurants. Accordingly it can be very busy but that said the night we dined the service was spot on as was the food. Classic French bistro style. Classic dishes,lots of flavour and lots of cream sauces..yum! Reasonable prices and the specials of the day are worth a try. We enjoyed the fresh asparugus.",13
5.0,IzzyTsao,June 21 2017,27,Our dinner here is a great experience. The waiter is funny and friendly. They have quite some seafood options. We ordered gambas cooked with whiskey and seafood cooked with anise. they were both cooked in very delicious sauces. portion isn't big but we were full in the end. The food is delicious and the service is friendly. I will recommend this place.,13
4.0,Kathleen Warren G,June 21 2017,88,This was recommended to us by a local and we are glad for it. The place is small but has both inside and outside seating. The menu had both traditional Lyonnaise food and standard French fare. We sampled some of each and food the food very tasty. We especially liked the lamb and seafood cassoulet. Our salads were fresh and imaginatively prepared. Serving size was more than ample. There is a good wine list and the proprietor helps you with your selections. The hotel is within walking distance of the city center and most hotels. It can get crowded so plan to arrive early.,13
1.0,Demon22,June 10 2017,196,"Even the most basic chef should know how to poach an egg, but not the one at this place. I had the salad Lyonnaise which is supposed to be topped with a soft poached egg. The egg on mine had a hard yolk and stringy white and the dressing was just white vinegar. My other halfs duck was stewed rather than crisp. Al in all a very disapoinpting start to our visit to the culinary capital of France.",13
3.0,Robyn P,May 26 2017,244,"Servers were run off their feet, we waited far too long for our meals, then some parts were missing, very disappointing. The veal scallopine with macaroni cheese was delicious, the seafood casserole was ok, not enough seafood and lacking flavour. Disappointing given that other meals we had in the area were fantastic. Keep off the main eat street and you will be rewarded, this place is just interested in turn over and profit.",13
4.0,Dolcebellamae,May 9 2017,301,"We couldn't find a place to serve omelettes after 11 so decided to stop here. Waiter was very friendly and spoke English which helped. We asked about omelettes(not in menu) and he said he would ask the chef-and he obliged. The dauphinois potatoes and filet were delicious, as was the omelette. Adorable decor and both inside and outside tables. Enjoyed the 2 hour experience I would recommend this place for friendliness and food.",13
5.0,Eleni_pap_601,April 18 2017,9,Very nice bouchon !This place was suggested by a local and for a reason!Traditional dishes prepared in a very nice way!Will definitely go back!,13

5.0,Robert O,April 4 2017,23,This was a reasonable priced dinner. The food was fabulous! Our group of six had just finished a Viking River Cruise and the food here was the best of the trip.,13
4.0,Harribaz,March 13 2017,119,"Recommended by the concierge at the hotel we had lunch here. Dining street side along with so many other very busy restaurants-(and fortunately lovely sunny weather)-made the whole experience really good. Service very good and attentive with good food well prepared, Definitely recommend for lunch.",13
4.0,Mark A,March 1 2017,120,"A fun stop on the slope this restuarant serves the best hot chocolate in Paradiski. It has a bar for dirnks, crepes bar and self serve restuarant. You can get pizza, salad, pasta, burgers etc. Seating is available on the terrace or inside upstairs.  This is a lovely place for the afternoon sun and at lunchtime it can be really busy, they manage the queue but it can take over 30minutes to queue up. As with all mountain options this is not the cheapest option around but the quality is good and the service is quick for anything cooked to order.",13
4.0,V√©ronique L,February 13 2017,17,"The place is pleasant, the food is Amazing and the price really correct. I highly recommend this place for dinner with friends, familly or even business dinners.",13
5.0,Suzie1624,December 13 2016,80,"Wanted somewhere local to the hotel where we could get some steak. Settled on this restaurant as it has fillet de boeuf on the menu. Arrived around 7pm and the place was empty. We were shown to a table in the window which gave us the opportunity to watch the world go by and to see the diners piling in. By 8 the restaurant was full and by 8:30 the overflow were put next door. The 2 waiting staff earned their money tonight, how they juggled all of the clients is anyone's guess, true professionals whose smiles didn't drop for a second. The food......delicious! I had charcuterie for my entree and fillet de boeuf with morels and dauphinois for my main. All washed down with a Cote de Rhone, cafe and a mint liqueur. A wonderful couple of hours, fantastic atmosphere (the place was buzzing) and superb food. Would definitely visit again if I was in Lyon.",13
5.0,broker40,December 1 2016,49,"Cozy and wonderful. The food was delicious too. I had the seafood cassoulet and it was divine, the wine that was recommended was perfect. If you are lucky enough to be there on the night they make their tarts do not pass them up. Make reservations or you'll be left out!",13
5.0,Henghist,November 2 2016,17,I love visiting ET when I'm in Lyon. It stands out in a city bejewelled with fine restaurants. Everything from the service to the traditional menu and excellent wine list. Love the Soupe de Poisson.,13
4.0,kosx4,October 26 2016,226,"Very cute restaurant on Rue Merciere in presqu ile. Very reasonable pre fixe menus with detailed wine list.

Add done local wine and c'est magnique.",13
5.0,Shari W,October 17 2016,7,"We had dinner here the first night of our stay in Lyon. We had good expectations - but just that.  First of all - the place is lovely - exactly what we envisioned for a restaurant in Lyon.  Second of all - the staff - delightful! Just absolutely delightful and helpful. And engaging!  As for the food - delicious. We had 2 ""appetizers"" and 2 entrees. We had really hoped to have a frommage plate for dessert - but we were stuffed! The food was delicious - and rich (perhaps because of what we ordered!). We had the escargot (decadently rich!), salad lyonnaise (like none we've had before - and haven't matched it since), seafood cassoulet, and monkfish.  For wine - we had a lovely rose that the server suggested. Went down like water!! Highly recommend!!!",13
5.0,DwainChicagoIL,September 27 2016,68,"Other reviewers summarize the food, atmosphere, service here perfectly well without me adding more except to urge you to visit this wonderful representation of Lyon without being pretentious or snobbish. Don't overthink it -- just go!",13
5.0,457Vanda,September 21 2016,20,"We had the set menu which was very reasonably priced for Lyon. There was a good selection of food for the starter, main and dessert. the food was excellent.",13
5.0,RileyBF,September 15 2016,35,"Our local host chose this restaurant, which a few people in our group had been to before and raved about it. Everyone loved their escargot and raviolis filled with foie...both dishes in amazingly decadent sauces. I had the salmon tartar as a starter, which was the best I had in Lyon..even the salad it came with had a delicious dressing. I had the seafood cassoulet, which was good...not huge, but filling nonetheless in its cream sauce with huge gamba, scallop and fish. Half of our group had the frog legs, which they all devoured! The chocolate fondant was the richest I've had this trip as well! Our Margaux wine at 59 euro a bottle was a good choice too! Overall, I'd recommend this and definitely return!",13
4.0,PaulBarrett98,August 28 2016,19,"We have been frequent visitors to Lyon over the past four decades and generally have learned to avoid the tourist areas of Rue Merciere and Vieux Lyon when choosing restaurants. Visting in August limited our choice with many of our favourite eateries being closed for their summer holidays. However Rue Merciere was still buzzing and we decided to visit Les EnfantsTerribles for dinner following the recommendation of a friend. I am pleased to say that we were not disappointed.  We chose 29.50 euro fixed price menu. This had a good choice of regular stalwarts and some additional dishes. The food was decent fare and service was generally friendly and attentive. My wife enjoyed her salmon which she said was cooked perfectly. My duck breast with morels was very tasty. Desserts were fairly basic [Cr√®me caramel or fromage blanc] , and sufficient for the price but probably not much to write home about.  All in all this was a decent meal at a reasonable price. Despite the"" honeypot"" location this is a place I'd be happy to return to.",13
1.0,lpks2016,August 12 2016,14,"I've never eaten such a terrible thing as their so called ""Baba au rhum"". Pricey for what it is : salad was average, burger was cold and everything was just laughable. Just pick some other place to eat would be my advice.",13

4.0,MalcolmA02,July 24 2016,537,"As it was Saturday and lots of restaurants in the more residential area we are staying in were closed we decided this area in the city centre was a safe bet for getting somewhere open. We didn't have high expectations re quality as it is quite a touristy area but the food we had was pretty good. I'd have preferred an option on TA to say 'Good' rather than either Average or Very Good but c'est la vie! We had the formule of the day with our starters of a warm goats cheese salad for me and a poached egg with smoked salmon for hubby. I'm not a great lover of goats cheese but thought I'd give it a shot and it was actually pretty good - not too strong. The other starter came with a lovely sauce (just wish I knew what it was - should have asked) so a very good start to the meal. We then both had the trout with almonds which was really well cooked and delicious (sometimes simple is definitely best). The creme caramel dessert was definitely home made and fine (although it's not my favourite dessert), it was light and smooth as it should be. All in all a very solid choice and I'd recommend to others.",13
4.0,Tivolifox,July 16 2016,24,"The restaurant was recommended by a local host. The setting is warm and cozy inside. Staffs were not exceptional in English but patient enough, making the service more than adequate and welcoming. Traditional french bistro food and Lyonnaise specialties are served. The steak and salads were fresh and of good quality. Quenelle was a bit bland and texture too indifferent to my taste. Overall a very comfortable supper at reasonable prices with warm services on a cool night. Would go again on Rue Merci√®re.",13
1.0,Atle T,July 6 2016,45,"If you want a meal without any passion, which you can easy make at home for an expensive price.. the food was terribly boring, I would recommend you to find a place outside of this street in general!",13
4.0,NatNatreviews,June 28 2016,406,We had a lovely lunch here. The food is unpretentious yet delicious and at a good price if you have the 2 course special. Staff are lovely and it's set in a vibrant street.,13
4.0,nancyen,June 21 2016,768,"We ended up having lunch here a couple of times, both later in the afternoon.  The service was efficient and friendly and the food was very good. The location, along a row of restaurants, is quite central to everything making it a good place to take a break from sightseeing.  They do not wrap up lunch service at 2:00, so it is perfect for those, like us, that need a later afternoon bite to eat.",13
5.0,Thomas Q,May 25 2016,106,"Our hotel (The Carlton) managed to fluke us a table at short notice on Saturday night, All old wood interiors with crisp white linen on marble table tops. Bustling and buzzing with young families, romantics, and gourmands in equal measure. Expect to pay 40 to 50 euros a head for 3 course with drinks for each course. Classic Lyonnaise menu with items such as tripe in pastry, calves head etc. For the more squeamish (like myself),opt for the fish stew of salmon, monkfish, and king prawn in the most unbelievable star anise cream sauce. Went back next lunchtime for the veal in a mustard cream sauce with the freshest, lightest pasta that I`ve ever eaten. Everything about the food here shows the passion for cooking, and the quality and freshness of the ingredients shines through. There are many ""bouchands"" offering similar fare, but this is one of the least pretentious. It`s popularity can be measured by the fact that there are no empty tables, and the queue of locals outside, so book in advance.",13

They were so busy, they nearly turned us away even though we had a reservation. They were able to seat us outside, which was fine because it was a lovely night out. The wait to order was long, but in the end, the food was well worth it! We enjoyed it so much, that we ate here another night during our stay and while the restaurant was nearly full, we were seated and our orders taken fairly quickly. Both nights,I started the meal with the tomate/mozzarella and for the main course, the Fricassee St. Jacques, which was a delicious scallop dish. We followed up our meal on the first night with the Lemon Tart-lovely and the next night, the hot chocolate cake in chocolate sauce with shaved almonds-heavenly! The service on the second night was superb. I highly recommend dining here.",13

Dinner was excellent, from the starters to the incredibly light and flavorful canelles (a fish mousse concoction in lobster sauce) to the creme caramel and cheese for dessert. Service was friendly and attentive even though the restaurant was full. There was a much smaller lunch crowd, but the menu prix-fixe for lunch was a real bargain. We had avocado gratin, topped with a langostino for the starter. I had a wonderful courgette and langostino ravioli in cream/chive sauce, and my husband had a fish dish with rice and a petite spinach souffle. All was top-quality.  We definitely will return on our next visit to Lyon.",13

2.0,Mamma708,May 20 2015,17,"If you have to dine at any of the busy restaurants at rue Merciere, this one might not even be your worst choice. But still: We chose this by recommendation in Tripadvisor and after seeing a friendly waiter smiling at people passing by ... It was a Saturday evening and the restaurant seemed to be very attractive - a queue outside spoke for this.  We were seated on a line of tables in the middle of the restaurant - tables were were attached to one another. It was too busy, too loud, too restless, too many clients seated too close to one another.  There were too few waiters / waitresses in our opinion. The ones on duty were nearly running which left us at unease - orders were forgotten and sometimes even the customers. A couple seated next to us waited to leave their order for a bit too long and finally decided to leave the place.  The ambiance was too hasty and too loud. Unfortunately the food did not make up for any of this. A salade de chevre as a starter was OK - hard to to miss. The main courses : - ribs de beauf a point; the meat was tasteless. A skewer of veal/lamb/boeuf with pommes dauphines was a poor suggestion of a meal; the meat was rock hard and unfortunately the potates did not make up for that. We also had to ask for our wine after main courses were already delivered - We could not wait to get out of the restaurant. Pity for the staff as they clearly tried their best. But you can only talk so fast and make your self understood and heard. Let alone hear the client who is placing an order - the place was understaffed (also the kitchen , as we could look right into it) and overcrowded. I do not recommend at all. Cost: A bottle of wine , 1 ltr of mineral water, entrees, main courses, 89 euros.",13

On our first evening we struggled to eat because we assumed people would eat late. I had foie de volaille salad to start and it was fantastic - garlicky heaven. Pigs trotters for main was tasty and nearly all bone - but I'm afraid that's really how pigs are made. A pot of vin rouge was good value.,13

Our concierge recommended Les Enfants Terribles (Naughty Children) located right in the middle of rue Merciere. It certainly looked the part but the food was nothing special.

I chose the sheep's foot for starter and a quenelle for main. Both dishes whilst intriguing were average and not what I expected from a restaurant on the main restaurant street in the city. To add to our woes, we had to wait nearly 20 mins after having finished our mains to be served again. It was fortunate that French film star Lambert Wilson was filming a few doors down as some star spotting was a welcome distraction.

The special sausage turned out to be an ‚Äúandouillette ‚Äúand the mustard sauce was just hot mustard. The tripe sausage was probably just as it should be, tasting boar and cowshed, so I should have known better, silly me. The ‚Äúsalted pork‚Äù dish chosen by my wife was ok, but nothing more. Our choice of a Chiroubles Beaujolais wine was served at about 32 C (outside temperature this day), and I would estimate, and it took about 20 minutes to accommodate our request for a cooler.

They knew we were British and handed us menus in English without the need for us to ask. By 8.00pm, every table was occupied.  We chose a wide range of starters amongst us, ranging from salad Lyonnaise to a fish soup. All six in our group thought our starters were excellent, if sometimes a little on the large side. Main courses were similarly good, and fairly generous in size. Desserts were also very good and were mostly traditional tarts. The only downside, and this was a minor issue, was that the coffees were very small and came with wholly insufficient milk leading to us having to ask for another jug. The restaurant was not cheap.
