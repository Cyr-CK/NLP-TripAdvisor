4.0,AngryofTollcross,October 18 2024,10,"Lovey simple meal at a bouchon. Good size portions. We tried smoked salmon, quenelles and beef cheeks.  Decent wine. Nice traditional decor. It is in a touristy area by the cathedral. As we were there on a Monday so not as busy and you can book online but we saw other parties walk in on spec. Staff were very nice and were patient with our beginner level French.",52
4.0,graceinbeijing,March 1 2020,71,"I had a lunch/dinner here ordering off one of the fixed price menus. It was very good food and good value. I had a nice salad Lyonaise with generous ham/bacon and perfectly poached egg, and very tasty and rich stew of tripe. My yogurt/cheese with berry sauce for dessert was also very good. Service was good, and it was relaxing with a good playlist.",52
5.0,Laura M,October 27 2020,1,"We made the reservation with ""the Fork"" and was a great decision. The waitress was very kind with us, that she talked with us in Spanish to make everything easier.  The service was quite quick and the food was superb. We had a Lyonnese Salad and 2 main plates and was more than enough, the plates ar copious and delicious.  I personally ate a steak tartar wich I definitely recomend. We end up very happy with the experience, we will surely recomend it to everybody and repeat when we go back to Lyon.  Très bien.",52
1.0,Tara Bee,June 11 2022,395,"We could clearly see the hygiene and cleanliness here is awful because two cups we were given were dirty, one given to replace the first dirty one was also dirty! In a post-covid world, this is completely unacceptable. Both waiters didn't speak any English and instead of a coffee in a plastic cup, they brought us a really tiny one. The second time a larger one came out but not in a takeaway cup. Too much effort just for a coffee and waste of almost €20 for a few hot drinks. Not worth the hassle. Go elsewhere.",52
5.0,Luna T,October 28 2024,61,"Upon arrival, the real welcome in cork: large table to which are already tabled unknown people (at the start). Then over an aperitif, of the 7 possible starters, main course, a digeo at your expense even if we think it is offered a priori, cheeses and dessert, all balanced by waiters of ouf, a great accordion player, the atmosphere warms up, we laugh and chat as if we were friends! Thank you for this suspended moment. It is certainly a little expensive looking at the simplicity of the dishes but simplicity at this level, it is worth it!!!",52
4.0,Mardi S,October 14 2022,156,"I see that others have given this tiny place less than glowing reviews, but we were very happy with the service, the cleanliness and the food. The staff were busy, but not so that they weren’t attentive, they were very pleasant and patient with our lack of fluent French. We had French onion soup, then the saucisse with pistachios and lentils, both of which were rich with flavour and perfectly seasoned. Desserts were, again, simple but good. Nothing to complain about here.",52
1.0,Tim W,February 5 2023,3,"There’s good attentive service, and there’s being hounded by staff. This place is definitely the latter. When you ask for “another few minutes” to choose your order (after being seated for 5) you don’t expect a literal 30 seconds before a return visit to see if you’re ready. The portion sizes are tiny too if ordering from the set menu vs a la carte. When I asked why my cheese selection consisted of 2 slices, I was told because I ordered from the set menu. Otherwise the portion size would be doubled apparently. Tourist trap. Avoid.",52
1.0,Gianluca P,May 27 2024,1,"After a (discreet) dinner with work colleagues, based on onion soup, fried tripe and tripe sausage, the following day, on the way back to Italy, I realize that I had forgotten my eyeglasses on the table. Once I arrive in Italy, I call the restaurant politely asking if it is possible to organize a shipment of the glasses to my address (obviously at my expense), but I am told that ""they don't have time for these things"" and that ""I owe the glasses to myself go and film at the club."" When I reply by saying that I have no new trips to Lyon planned and that they would be doing me a great favor if they could send them to me (at my expense, I repeat), in response they hang up on me. My advice: make sure you don't forget anything before leaving this restaurant. Congratulations for your education and hospitality!",52
1.0,Óliver R,June 3 2024,4,"I'm not one to write reviews when they're negative, but this time I feel compelled to do so. I ate some cheeks that made me spend one of the worst nights of my life. We ordered a salad to share and they brought us an extra plate that we didn't use because it was dirty. The waiters are polite, but it's useless if they then feed you pure poison. The pity was that when we took a look at the kitchen, we were already leaving through the door, because otherwise we wouldn't have even entered. In summary: food in poor condition, non-existent cleaning, excessive heat and very expensive for what they offer.",52
5.0,Pascal Perret,March 11 2024,39,"We come to Lyon regularly and we have frequented a large number of restaurants, some on the advice of our friends in this city. This time we booked at the Auberge des Canuts without being advised to do so. Well it was the best meal and it became our favorite restaurant. My wife, who eats a pike dumpling every time, said it was her favorite. For my part I liked the meurette eggs and the pistachio sausage with lentils was incredible. The Internet reservation system worked very well (some cork owners do not take reservations from abroad by telephone). We were welcomed like popes, served quickly and with a smile. 5 star service and we will come back, promise!",52
1.0,Andres R,August 29 2023,3,"I had made a reservation with The Fork. It took them a while to find the reservation, but after a while they found it. Then two waiters started joking with each other to see who would guide me to a table, thinking I wasn't understanding them. I chose to sit inside because the terrace was full and I preferred to be quiet. They took me to the upper floor which was practically empty: a table with 5 people and another with a couple. There was a waitress at the time and the one who escorted me from the entrance. They kept me waiting for a while, until I sat in one of the empty chairs, to wait for them to tell me which table to sit at. The waitress on that floor only wasted time making unnecessary trips, although without bringing me the menu or addressing me. After more than 15 minutes he reluctantly decided to come and bring me the letter. I then told him that he had been very unprofessional and that I would rather not eat there. I asked for the manager to tell him the reason for leaving. He responded to me in a very bad way. At that moment I understood that the waiters also acted reluctantly and unprofessionally. In the end I was grateful because I ended up eating at a restaurant where the service, food, and atmosphere were wonderful.",52
5.0,Sabine S,November 10 2023,46,"This little restaurant is a gem The place is welcoming, the decoration is neat and authentic. We really enjoyed this return in time by listening to old songs The waiters are very pleasant, helpful and smiling and we feel that they love their job because they like to talk about the good dishes on the menu. The dishes are hearty and authentic In short, a real moment of pleasure",52
5.0,John V,October 12 2023,6,Great local dishes enjoyed with good friends al fresco on the edge of the square in front of St. John Baptist. Les Canuts were able to handle all 9 of us by just setting out more tables and chairs. Staff were both efficient and delightful. They helped make the our evening at a Lyonnais bouchon mémorable.,52
1.0,Famille badel,April 1 2024,8,"Excessive price compared to the quantity (as a starter, mini slice of brioche sausage and lots of salad, 2 to 3 pieces of beef cheek with tasteless wine sauce, praline tart revisited as a cheesecake where you don't find the taste at all pralines).., and quality of the dishes. Very very tight table. Very very friendly staff. We had the gnafron menu for 39 euros...it's not worth more than 25 euros... I do not recommend...",52
1.0,Trek61489695964,August 27 2023,1,"very big disappointment with a fillet of Charolais beef: the meat was overcooked even though I had asked for rare, the sole inedible. morels full of sand and tasteless. the sauce thick and tasteless. when someone asks me how it was and I very politely point it out: nothing bad... I strongly advise against it.",52
2.0,kiko7270,June 3 2024,5,"Friendly staff but poor cooking. Soft-boiled egg in a sticky red wine sauce and bacon that is way too fatty. Canteen-level edible dumplings and the sapper apron (beef belly, etc.) is a horror. As an aperitif, we bring you pieces of brisket (rather pieces of fat) grilled in the deep fryer, certainly so salty that it's inedible. Trap tourists. “Big” disappointment.",52
4.0,Papikok,January 22 2024,682,"As the lunch offer on December 31 was limited, we had reserved this address well located opposite the cathedral. It was a good thing for us because when we left the queue was long! Good Lyonnais dishes on the menu. Personally, my sapper apron was perfect. The service is very efficient, certainly a little urgent but without exaggeration. We appreciated.",52
4.0,Laurent G,November 1 2024,110,"Great location on Place St Jean, perfect for exploring the Old Lyon district. Very welcome despite a little excessive waiting. The plates are well stocked and the price / quality ratio is correct for the very touristic area. To be done once to discover.",52
3.0,Jenny G,May 27 2024,64,"Disappointed in this restaurant after hearing so many good reviews. The atmosphere was good and the location excellent, but the service was just ok, and the food was well below what was expected. The Salad Lyonnaise had soggy lettuce leaves, some egg shell pieces and rock hard overcooked croutons, and the pork, while tasty, had plenty of gristle left in it. The beef cheeks were well cooked and tasty, but although mentioned in the menu, we were unable to find any trace of cognac or mushrooms in the sauce. Crème brûlée dessert was mediocre at best. Wouldn’t visit a second time; there are plenty of other Bouchon restaurants nearby that should be able to better this one.",52
3.0,Jb M,August 19 2024,4,"A little disappointed with the experience! Service too fast see expeditious , I received my pastis with my stale egg An onion soup without really the taste of onion and bland The quality of the products seems correct for a kitchen that remains simple Desserts without real interest and far too expensive for quality A praline pie so revisited that you can smell more praline with a wet dough and a bland crème brûlée In summary disappointed with the experience especially for a cap listed in the Cap Ranking. Very expensive for what it is We do not recommend",52
5.0,SEGOLENE G,October 8 2023,39,"Good authentic Lyonnaise cuisine of very good quality. Eggs in meurette, Lyonnaise salad, pâté, andouillette, beef cheek... All washed down with a pot of Croze Hermitage to match the meal. The staff is very welcoming, the service is quick and organized despite the crowds (the restaurant was full). A good experience that we already want to repeat.",52
2.0,Martine,February 25 2024,4,"Eggs meurette... More water than wine, bacon pieces roughly cut and barely cooked, all lukewarm... Any dumpling with very little sauce.. Homemade? To see... Served with dry rice.. Gourmet coffee. : Any... Praline tart so revisited that it only has the color of the praline... Absent taste... In short, nothing of Lyon cuisine, an address to forget",52
5.0,Patrick M,August 26 2024,67,Small Lyonnais very friendly stopper located at the foot of Fourrière. Welcome and friendly and smiling service. Small card well stocked. The cuisine is tasty and the portions could not be more correct even on the menu. Reasonable Award. Everything was good from starter to dessert. Anything to have a good time. The Top,52
5.0,Lord U,May 5 2024,42,"Totally flawless, the local food, typically Lyonnaise, is a pure delight, both in terms of quality and quantity. The welcome from the staff is professional, smiling and available. The quality-price ratio reflects the image of this establishment: excellent. As for the location, it is ideal in old Lyon. My wife and children were delighted, and that is priceless.",52
5.0,Duchesse de Bre... M,November 5 2023,20,"Very friendly and authentic Lyonnais cork. We discovered local specialties, our favorite: the delicious and generous egg meurette! The service was perfect and attentive, the atmosphere very welcoming, a great Lyon experience. We are always delighted with Maîtres Restaurateurs restaurants, it is a guarantee of quality in all respects and a real reference",52
5.0,michael b,August 7 2023,1,"Not only is the location ideally located but, the welcome is more than pleasant, the team is very pleasant, smiling, shout out to our young waiter who took care of us (he will recognize himself, I am the man with the cane 😏) Let's get to the heart of the matter: the meal was just delicious, no false notes, quality and quantity were there. During your visit to Lyon, don't hesitate to go there. A must-see establishment. Go there smiling, life is more beautiful this way!!! See you soon",52
3.0,Mathilde K,February 24 2024,94,"The onion soup is fluffy and lacks ""gratin"". The quenelle is good but nothing more. In short, nothing to beat your ass about. The welcome is not particularly warm either. In short, move on. I don't know how this cork was able to obtain the label ""bouchon lyonnais"".",52
3.0,Whittlesford,February 23 2023,593,"This place is in just the spot to appeal to tourists, which could be a warning sign. But in fact the young staff run a perfectly good restaurant with reasonable prices. It's also full, even outside the tourist season. The feel of the place is definitely ""bouchon"" and the menu contains quite a bit of offal - and none the worse for that. The decor is a bit on the wacky side, especially upstairs but the staff cope well with it.",52
5.0,permia,December 9 2023,66269,"In the atmospheric Place in view of the stunning Cathedral we had one of the best dining experiences. Enhanced by outside seating and as the sun began to ebb. Opting for the traditional fare, everything was deliciously flavoursome. Accompanied by local wine. After a decent interval onwards to dessert, with coffee. It was a wonderful occasion, complemented by pleasant friendly staff and exceptional value.",52
5.0,Touch&Co,May 28 2024,15,"I thought I knew the andouillette ficelle well, but there...I tasted one...which made me say that in fact I had never eaten a real andouillette ficelle. A pure delight. Top culinary experience throughout the meal, and very welcoming staff.",52
5.0,MNF,November 11 2024,2,"Very friendly cork. Decor, welcome, service, kitchen... Everything was together for a great evening with friends. Especially the staff with the smile and humor it takes to make you feel comfortable.... E la cuisine .... the apron of sapper!!!!  Congratulations to the whole team",52
4.0,luis T,August 10 2024,391,"Friendly service Nice quiet terrace with room if you have children Lyon cork the quenelles are good and the rice pudding excellent Too bad for a traditional cork to have Ikea glasses, we made the remark to the waitress hoping that this bad point will be changed. France produces beautiful Duralex glasses 😉",52
5.0,Raphaël M,August 5 2023,1,"Tourist place with quality traditional dishes, well-prepared beef tartare, andouillette from a very good butcher's shop in Lyon. Rum baba with the bottle of rum. We had a great time. Very friendly staff.³",52
4.0,Chris G,December 29 2023,1459,"We had lunch with family in this Lyonnais restaurant located next to the cathedral. The welcome is pleasant, the staff are smiling and friendly. Fast and efficient service. The cuisine is made with fresh products and beautifully presented. We had the choice between 4 starters, 4 main courses and around ten desserts. The wine list offers a wide choice. The only downside is that the price is a little high. Between 29 and 42 euros for menus.",52
3.0,nuziders,June 4 2024,48,Friendly service but on the other hand the dishes are not at the level of what we expect from a Lyonnais cork. The eggs in meurette (Burgundy and not Lyonnais) are average. Uninteresting desserts. The wines chosen to accompany our dishes are more than average. The biggest doubt comes from the mineral water which really tasted like tap.,52
5.0,G M,December 17 2023,16,Small restaurant in a pleasant setting located right next to the cathedral The welcome was very friendly and the advice was sound (without pushing consumption). The dishes were excellent and generous portions. We will happily return there during our next stay in Lyon.,52
4.0,Chloe Mt,June 4 2024,187,"Friendly place representative of the restaurants of old Lyon. Pleasant staff (even if we were served by several different people, maybe too many).  Good egg meurette (a discovery for me), a good quenelle but which lacked a little taste in terms of the sauce. A plus for the revisited praline tart which I don't usually like because it was too sweet but here with fromage blanc, it made it lighter.  Address that must be tested!",52
5.0,sylvie d,November 13 2024,2,"We found this little cork, thanks to the comments on different sites and and and we were not disappointed, very friendly welcome and really good cuisine At the end of the dinner, we shared a few moments of conviviality with our table neighbors and that is nice Thank you again.",52

5.0,Jean-christophe G,November 24 2024,1,"A first visit, but I assure you, it will not be the last. I have my habits in some Lyonnais establishments where I like the atmosphere there, but this one I did not know. We were immediately put in the mood thanks to the welcome of Nadège, Thomas and Coco without forgetting the others... Very good plates. Friendly and typical of the traffic jams. I'll go back either with friends or for business lunch. I recommend this place.",52
5.0,Tom J,March 9 2024,53,I dined here alone whilst in the city on business. It’s charming little place with views of the cathedral and square. Very friendly staff that kindly spoke English. I ordered the beef cheeks which were superb. Great beer as well. Very impressed.,52

1.0,19Eric57,December 14 2024,2548,"It is exceedingly rare for me to be thrown out of a restaurant with such rudeness. And even if we are, no doubt, in the stress and crowds of the Festival of Lights, this kind of behavior is unacceptable. We arrived at two, on the day of the launch of the Festival of Lights. Our goal was to have an aperitif, participate in the sound and light on Place Saint-Jean and then return to the establishment for dinner. This restaurant has a good reputation and we spotted it. We entered the establishment and were greeted by a lovely young girl. But when we arrived in the main room, a very gruff matron made it clear to her attendant that there was no question of serving us... If we could have understood that the tables had to be prepared for dinner, this abrupt and particularly rude way of “throwing us without even looking at ourselves”, shocked us greatly.
