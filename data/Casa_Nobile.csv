4.0,Panda,July 17 2020,32,"It‚Äôs a very genuine Italian restaurant, with fresh ingredients of an excellent quality, especially the buffalo mozzarella. We had a couple of pasta plates, a pizza and a salad. As top as in Italy. The service is pleasant and kind too, being very good, the place can be crowded.",15
5.0,Dr Sue M,October 24 2024,149,"I had the wonderful culinary experience of dining at Casa Nobile in Lyon, France, twice so far. The food is delicious but get there early because there will be a long line! They open for dinner at 7:30 so arrive 15 or 20 mins early. I ordered the linguini in clam sauce and it was recommend by local. It was excellent, not expensive and friendly service! The pizza ooh lala!",15
5.0,No,May 10 2024,102,"The only well-known downside: does not take reservations. Apart from this small point, the menu is varied, here the prices have not been excessively affected by inflation (which is good for most restaurants on the Presqu 'island...) and are reasonable! The dishes are all very good and plentiful! üçù PS: I recommend the eggplant pasta yum accompanied by a glass of Italian wine",15
2.0,France,October 29 2024,16,"The last time I went to this pizzeria I had taken anti-pasti which were excellent. This time it was very disappointing, especially mushrooms and spinach that had sand and were, for me, inedible.... I reported it to the young woman who was looking after me, she told me she was going to report it in the kitchen. Arriving at the cashier I thought maybe I would be offered coffee and not even....",15
4.0,sola123,June 22 2023,530,"This very busy spot spreads out around the corner and oozes down the block. Pasta is hit and miss. The daily special of ravioli was great, but another daily special of linguini with calamari was fishy and rubbery. Maybe stick with the pizzas that are big and pillowy crusted. This is a great place to grab lunch before shopping.",15
5.0,dvorac4,January 21 2023,759,"Rue Grollee, on west small street across from hotel Amazing Neapolitan pizza! Very soft gluteny and blistered puffy crust with lots of melted mozzarella and provolone cheese. Wine Veneto Gran Passione Rosso ‚Äì a favorite of the owner and very good. Server Maira is wonderful, professional, and friendly; good salads. 6 small tables outside; none inside; mostly delivery. Small satellite location for main restaurant a few blocks away which is large and extremely popular with long lines. This location‚Äôs customers are locals. Very quiet and cozy.",15
3.0,Papitrac,November 14 2024,25,"Bof, bof‚Ä¶. Kind welcome, but average cuisine, like big food. Italians usually know how to do better. My overcooked veal saut√© sole and the accompaniment of tasteless pasta. I couldn‚Äôt even finish this pasta. We had been warned, but we had not heeded it. We should have!!!",15
4.0,maeverilhac,August 1 2023,82,"Very good Italian moment for two. For the lady: delicious clam pasta with a VERY VERY tasty broth at the bottom of the plate! For Monsieur: pasta also, with eggplant, basil, and parmesan: very good too. Pure quality products with fast service, despite the fact that the restaurant is SHIELDED every evening. We said to ourselves each time while watching the queue in front: ‚Äúit must be really good‚Äù: ma√© from the future affirms: it‚Äôs really good Go there without hesitation",15
1.0,Sveta,January 7 2024,5,"A restaurant with a good reputation but a big disappointment. Tasteless cheese, overcooked and flavorless pasta. Exhausted servers, need to make money with a continuous flow of people. Working in the gastronomy field, I would not recommend this place.",15
5.0,Ernesto,September 15 2023,11,"The queue is the reflection of a real pizzeria, from pastas to pizzas and dolce. Even our server was Italian. Simple and high quality, here even the trattorias are at the gastronomic level of Lyon. A pleasure and a culinary change of scenery.",15
3.0,Romain A,March 8 2024,97,"We arrived at a time when for once there was no queue. The reception was average. Sitting outside in the sun it was pleasant, but the cooking is far from being at the level I expected. The truffle pizza was generous with ham, but without any particular flavor, rather classic. The prices are correct but the value for money is not great.",15
2.0,Nimes1947,September 12 2023,3,"We took suppli and arancini to go...and we have never had such bad ones!! My husband is Roman and lived in Sicily so knows them very well and I make them regularly at home but they are inedible: breading as hard as wood, stuffing that has nothing to do with suppli or arancini . In addition, no mozzarella, the so-called truffle supplis were stuffed with a kind of bad ham, those called ragu only had tomato! Finally, if the whole kitchen is like that, carefully avoid! More than disappointed, disgusted (it was our dog who finished the begging!)",15
3.0,Elisabeth D,September 27 2024,43,"Restaurant more than overrated! The welcome is neither good nor bad, we settle you, cash you and basta, without a smile, nothing! However, it could catch up a bit with the quality of the food... Uncooked pizza, elastic dough, barely melted cheese, for 15 euros anyway, unseasoned antipastis, we are not far from Italian cuisine! It all looks like it, but it doesn't. Don't trust the tail, it doesn't guarantee quality. I had already tested once, I thought I had fallen on a bad day or made a bad choice but this visit will be my last.",15
5.0,seb0469,October 17 2023,104,"A great Italian restaurant, with a beautiful Italian menu and organized in an Italian style. I had fettuccini carbonara. Delicious, well-made Italian sauce without cream, perfecto. A lemonade with Sicilian lemons. And a dolci tiramisu, not sugar Leg√© to finish a meal.",15
4.0,Emi,March 12 2024,8,"So it was a nice restaurant, very good pizzas. I had the vegetarian pizza, on the advice of our waitress, I was not disappointed. On the other hand the tartufo pizza, which was very good attention, but the taste of the truffle was not emphasized enough. It's plentiful, the staff is very pleasant, great service.",15
2.0,Anne Marie Q,December 19 2023,1,"Very close to the toilets, while I had been waiting for a while, they cleaned the toilets with cresyl, a powerful industrial disinfectant. The smell remained throughout the meal. I had it noted by the waiter, at the cash register, the boss denied everything!!!! Spoiled meal.",15
2.0,Gregory F,November 28 2024,50,"Restaurant that accommodates bcp too much cover compared to its production capacity. So the wait is endless to be served. Oblivions are in the game, non-existent responsiveness. The dishes are very expensive compared to the quality. The pizza dough is excellent, but the accompaniment inside is questionable. A very unpleasant rumble which prevents you from being able to exchange around the same table. Cleanliness of the only toilet to review! A restaurant to run away from.",15
2.0,parismetz2016,November 22 2023,401,"Lunch break next to my work, a vegetable bread. Tasteless tomatoes Industrial mozzarella Spinach out of the bag And bread with oil When the waitress asked me if it was good, I preferred to say nothing, but half was left",15
1.0,Richard Isa,November 21 2023,4,"Very good pizza but that costs you 50 euros!!! because it tells me that the restaurant ticket card payment has not gone through, I trust and represent another card to pay... After verification the 1st payment was validated, the scam! Since then I have tried to contact them, never answer the phone and send x emails and no response! Too bad I am more than 100km away... Place to avoid, no confidence.....",15
4.0,Cam√©lia & Loan,March 2 2024,74,Very good Italian restaurant in Lyon! We had a pizza (Tartufo) and a pasta dish (alla Norma). Italian requires Tiramisu for dessert. We feasted ! Hearty dishes and quality food! We will come back üëåüèº,15
5.0,asyaschwin,April 26 2024,880,"Great restaurant, no reservations so a queue at the opening, but that goes away quickly. The interior a little reduced especially if the quest is formed to pay. Good food, generous and well-stocked antipasti plates (single is more than enough for two as a starter). Rather traditional but super tasty pizza and pasta. Too bad no wines in carafes but I'm quibbling there. To recommend",15
5.0,Debra G,June 1 2024,54,We enjoyed our dinner at Forno Nobil (although the charge on the bill came through as La Stella D'Oro Lyon). I had the pasta with gorgonzola sauce which was delicious. My husband said the same about his gnocchi . And wine was reasonably priced for a change.,15
4.0,Erdogan U,October 24 2024,31,"Pizza was delicous, cosy atmosphere and good service we like it very much. Location was perfect also. ƒ∞f you gonna eat pizza in lyon this is the place",15
5.0,Roger R,May 17 2024,833,By chance happened upon this highly rated Italian restaurant Wow the veal dinner with pasta and salad I had was wonderful The pizza was amazing The decoration was fun I want to go back soon,15
5.0,Fiona T,September 29 2023,1,"Best restaurant in Lyon. Superb Italian food. We ate the pasta marinara, schnitzels, lamb and tiranisu. Great friendly staff. A must when in Lyon!!",15

5.0,1991KEB,March 18 2022,1649,You know how pizza is routine in Europe but these guys were wonderful. The pizza was thick and just baked to perfection. The ham was spicy and oh so tasty. Nice folks doing good food.,15
5.0,jean-pierre F,July 18 2020,224,"Amazing place !!!! Food is delicious, place is nice. A real Italia place. I recommend the fettuccine Cacioepepe with parmigiana cheese cocked with grappa",15
1.0,EAS_BP,November 23 2019,14,"We went for Lunch on a saturday. No booking in advance possible. 1h30 to wait. Service very stressed. 1 bottle of water for 7 people. Our demand to get another one after the first one was empty was ignored until the end. We were not allowed to share a dish. Each one had to order one, house rules, ridiculous. The owner is very arrogant and made us pay for a waiters mistake. Antipasti ordered for 1person was served for 2. Saying ""i dont care"" Even though the Pizza was good we keep a really bad memory as the rest was really annoying and bad. Really not to recommend.",15
5.0,talal,October 26 2019,38,This is really one of the best Italian restaurant that you can taste the real Italian pizza Very busy place Worth time to wait and with every single money I really like it üòãüòãüòã,15
5.0,Jane H,June 22 2019,31,"Beautiful fresh Italian food - no booking so you need to be prepared to queue, though we only waited around 10 mins. Very busy place, great staff and food was absolutely delicious- the antipasto platter was so full of beautiful meats and vegetables, an absolute must!! We were so full couldn‚Äôt try dessert but they all looked amazing and everything home cooked and fresh. Highly recommend this restaurant!!",15
2.0,SofiaEste,June 8 2019,2,"The pizzas were excellents, made with fresh products but unfortunately the service was really awful. The waitress was extremely disrespectful, impatient and he treated us in a bad way. Also, we ordered in french and he responded always in italien (later we heard him talking perfectly in french with others clients...).",15
5.0,London Reviews,March 19 2019,2,A queue out of the door. A reputation that preceded it. Amazing food. A list of smooth red wines. Staff who are attentive even though they are rushed off their feet. And a modest price. This place is simply the best Italian in Lyon.,15
4.0,chl0e48,December 12 2018,191,"We were jammed in on the upper floor. Food was great. Desert was even better, but we didn't understand we had to take out table number downstairs to pay. OK, we got with the program, but there was a huge backlog trying to leave. We were standing on top of the food (seriously bumping into a giant bowl of cheese used for the alfredo), the temperature was suffocating, we were in the way of the servers and downstairs diners for 15 or 20 minutes to get out. (Yes, I'm the ugly american who has worked in food service and really wanted to redesign their system!) Other than that, it was great.",15
5.0,Pierre V,December 11 2018,229,"Amazing pizzas like in the old times and everything looked very fresh and well done. the other dishes looked very well and people around us were very happy of their meal, whatever it was: anti pasti, pasta, seafood and such. Strongly recommended",15
5.0,Andy P,November 1 2018,86,"After reading the TripAdvisor reviews we finally got in for lunch. With both limited Italian and French we were comforted by three very helpful wait staff. The restaurant was fully booked when we attended after a short wait we were taken to a table downstairs. We had the seafood risotto, vongole with a beautiful Italian wine followed by cannoli and coffee. Do not miss this restaurant when in Lyon outstanding service beautiful Italian food",15
5.0,BigDeclan,September 16 2018,19,This was for us a genuinely very pleasant full Italian meal in a lovely part of Lyon. Good menu with very good food served by excellent staff. There was no rush to get you in and out but we were left to enjoy our courses and good Sicilian wine. Highly recommended in a lovely part of Lyon.,15
5.0,EloBP,August 28 2018,21,"We love this restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious every time! Its authentic Italian cuisine in Lyon. The service is always really good, the atmosphere fun and lively and the owner is really friendly. There are ALWAYS queues to get a table so get there early!",15
5.0,Chris A,August 5 2018,448,"I‚Äôve been quite a few times to this place however this is the first time I‚Äôve decided to review it. I visited it with my colleagues on Friday night and had a great dinner. The selection of food is great; plenty of pizzas and pastas, a few meats and a few appetizers. Everything was perfectly cooked and very tasty. The wine selection is fair, albeit not exhaustive, and all of the choices are local (Italy). Would recommend this place whether you‚Äôre looking for a romantic or just for a business dinner.",15
5.0,Lisa B,August 1 2018,29,"Just got to Lyon after a couple of days in Paris where I really struggled with eating out being allergic to wheat. This restaurant not only had amazing choice and quality but also understood what being allergic to wheat was rather than offering me bread or even more mortifying being asked to leave. The quality of the salads was amazing, the pizza my husband had was beautiful and my seafood risotto was astoundingly good. Great wine and beer also.",15
5.0,Patricia S,May 23 2018,2,"TOP!   Really excellent lunch out Will return Service excellent. Food top class. Fresh, authentic italian food. Delicious!",15
5.0,Luis F,May 10 2018,28,"The best italian in Lyon. Fresh, home made food in a superb location. Their delicious capressa salad consists of home made burrata w/pesto and black olives. Do not miss succulent desserts such as ""Cassata"". Limonata digestive is on the house üòä",15
3.0,bchrysos,October 2 2017,195,"I went there after reading the reviews and was extremely disappointed. The pizza is good, the service nice but the rest of the dishes are simply fast food. The basil on top of the lasagne does not drastically change it to authentic Italian. One guest got the sea bream which was undercooked. The pizzas are good but the desserts were not. The pana cota was rubbery, the red fruit sauce was not homemade and the tiramisu lacked taste.",15
5.0,georgehiner3,July 23 2017,27,"The pizza was fantastic. Amazing dough, and amazing ingredients - The pizza Nobile was honestly the best pizza I've ever had. To top it off the portion size was great too! Book in advance or go late!",15
4.0,brianandgail,July 11 2017,174,"We were advised to book and were glad we did so. There was not a great choice of tables for couples even though we arrived early. However, the friendly service and the excellent food made up for this. There was no bruschetta on the menu but the waitress somehow managed to conjure one up for us - a sign of efficient and flexible restaurant service.",15
5.0,Marianne S,June 23 2017,18,We went there for dinner. Friendly service and efficient service. The quality of the food is awesome. The portions are generous. I will go back in my next visit to Lyon.,15
5.0,pdemeo,May 10 2017,150,"Excellent restaurant. You MUST make reservations or you won't get a table for dinner. I had fettuccine carbonara which was the best pasta dish I ever had. My husband had the pizza and he said it's the best pizza he ever had! The couple sitting next to us were Italians who live in Lyon and they said it's the best Italian restaurant in Lyon. The staff doesn't speak English, but luckily the young Italian couple did and we had a nice time chatting with them. The bottle of Chianti was delicious. Even though the staff didn't speak English, they are extremely friendly. The ambiance is not fancy - it's very casual/pizzeria style restaurant. I would highly recommend eating at Casa Nobile when in Lyon.",15
5.0,geulabr,April 12 2017,151,"Dinner for a family. Had excellent buratta for first, then pizza (excellent) pasta, Devine risotto and the beef. All were excellent. Place not very cheap but all ingredients are originally from Italy. Most recommended",15
5.0,Groovemasterjay,January 2 2017,303,"That is a superb surprise ! This restaurant doesn't seem to be special, from the outside, but one indicator is that it is always overbusy. Good sign. Then enter, and you're in Italy. The ambiance, the mood, the design... and then, the food. Ok, you may wonder it is just another place where you can eat pizzas. No. You don't eat pizzas there. You eat a part of Italy. It's not pizza. It's art. Go for it. And you'll never eat pizzas elsewhere in Lyon !",15
5.0,Rami M,December 25 2016,17,"By far the best pizza in France, and in all the countries I visited. Authentic place, with Italians running it, top ingredients, hospitality, menu and not expensive, at all. Pizza Roman is world-class, highly recommended.",15
4.0,Jordi V,November 15 2016,266,"The place is small but the food service and the restaurant are excellent. We have been there a group of friends and we have take a good dinner . Specially recomended the pasta . The price is not cheap , if you add wine and desert the dinner can be expensive",15
5.0,Chris de Cani,October 30 2016,125,"Replete with exotic sausage. fish cakes and buckets of snails after four days in this terrific town, madam had expressed a desire for some pasta after matters had taken a turn for the worse earlier in the day when I had let myself down while accompanying Madam to the many shops on the Rue de la Republique. Indifference is not the required state for clothes shopping apparently and after an interminable couple of hours at the tills a state of high dudgeon had developed that could only be quelled by my sourcing of some perfect pasta.  Casa Nobile seemed to draw some favourable comment in this parish with many advising to book beforehand, which we struggled to do, so rocked up at the establishment on the off chance of a table. A high risk approach, given my earlier misdemeanours that nonetheless added a certain frisson to the evening.  We were accommodated on the proviso that we'd be done within the hour, which thankfully was not a problem for either of us.  A plate of cheese, with rocket, basil and tomatoes for a shared starter which served as an instant placator and was consumed within ten minutes. A brief pause before plunging into two different pasta dishes, which were also very nice and the equal of similar dishes we have had served to us in some parts of Italy.  Madam punished the Pinot Grigio, while I mullered the Merlot both of which complemented the meal perfectly whenever they touched the sides.  After forty five minutes we had given our all and were ready to be substituted.  Great atmosphere, good food made with quality ingredients and super staff. Price was competitive with what we had paid for our dinner for much of our week in Lyon.  If you require good food in an authentic Italian Trattoria experience while in Lyon, give this place a go, although expect it to be busy.",15
3.0,Phil G,July 31 2016,496,"Service was so bad it really ruined the experience. Such a shame because the food was pretty good. Maybe we hit a bad time, but really no excuse for such atrocious service. Would not go back. Too many good places with good service.",15
5.0,Rod B,July 6 2016,61,"We found this Italian restaurant on the internet, where it said you needed to book ahead; but we tried our luck anyway - were initially refused, but then ""fitted in"". We were lucky! Don't do that - book ahead. The food was exquisite and authentically Italian. The ambiance was also authentically Italian, joyful, animated and sometimes loud because the restaurant was completely full. The staff were attentive, pleasant, helpful, prompt and efficient - and coped with our English, laced with rather questionable French. Some do staff speak English, but not all - though that is not a problem. We booked for the next night when ordering our second course! In the end we went there every evening we were in Lyon (3 times) and were impressed each time. The menu is extensive enough to provide different meals on several visits. We booked a table upstairs by the window overlooking the street. Great! Free wifi is also available. This place is thoroughly recommended.",15
4.0,Lydie R,June 1 2016,96,"Lovely restaurant, try and get a table outside if weather is nice. Busy and friendly place with attentive service and reasonable prices. Pizzas are made there and they did not mind us adding ingredients to make our own delicious pizzas.",15
4.0,MRB,April 13 2016,63,Very cute Italian place. The pizza is cooked in wood-fired oven which is open to the seating area and so the aroma of freshly baked goods fills the air adding to the cosy warm vibes of the place. Very authentic italian food and the pizza is one of the best I have had in Lyon.,15

5.0,xicolopes,January 28 2016,164,"If Casa Nobile doesn't serve the best Italian food in Lyon, I don't know who does. My wife, daughter and I dined there one evening and the food was absolutely delicious. I had probably the best seafood risotto ever, my wife had veal parmesan and our daughter a pasta dish. Service was rushed because of the time of our visit (Friday, 8:30 p.m.) and the number of other diners, but nothing to complain about. reservations are recommended because this is a very popular spot. Just steps away from Place Bellecour. Casa Nobile has become our favorite Italian restaurant. It's pricey, so be prepared.",15
