3.0,Tilou & Balle,November 5 2023,2,"The setting and decoration are very pleasant but once seated, it is immediately less pleasant. We were upstairs, stuck between 2 tables of strangers and we couldn't even hear each other talk (hello privacy)! However, we had reserved a long time ago but some people without reservations were placed before us and at better tables. Regarding the cocktails: excellent! For the food, the guacamole was very nice (lacking a little spice), the grilled pig quesadillas were succulent but on the other hand the beef tacos were quite bland :( The service lacked a little professionalism even if we understand that the beginnings are always complicated... In short, a good experience but we will not be returning immediately.",247
3.0,Velidhu91,February 19 2024,297,"I agree with several previous opinions: the setting is very nice, colorful, warm; the service rather efficient, the staff smiling. But I was not convinced by the dishes, which I found bland, without relief... The quesadillas seemed quite industrial to me and the accompanying salad was wilted... Probably nicer just for a cocktail-guacamole option, but not sure I'll go back for dinner. The value for money is not there in my opinion.",247
3.0,GOUNI,October 29 2024,137,"Welcome to the nice entrance and very friendly decoration, as in the photos. Medium-clean toilet, and a dirty cleaning cloth lying on a piece of furniture in the main room, cobwebs in the room visible from the outside. Despite the pleasant setting, I doubt about hygiene. The tables are glued together, we enjoy all the conversation of the neighbors. The coktails are correct and reasonable prices. Cold service, no smiles, we are encouraged to have starters and dishes served at the same time (""do you mind if we bring everything at the same time?""). Well....we didn't dare say no, but the fact is that the hot dishes were warm or cold, and there was no room to put everything on the table....(we put the vase on the floor, and the glasses on the shelf behind.) We didn't get a decanter of water, and the red wine by the glass was at room temperature, like 22 degrees....I put on an ice cube even though I hate doing that. The bib is very special, some parts of the piece are stringy and there is a sauce ready made in tube...not top...There is too much creamy sauce in tacos, but it is rather pretty and tastes good. We found that the ceviche place was not bad... We didn't have dessert. In the end, it's as expected, very nice, very instagram, but hygiene and food to perfect. Good time, though.",247
1.0,val√©rie t,February 12 2024,1,"To flee !!!! The beautiful decor is not enough to have a good time. Unpleasant welcome, wait of 15 minutes before you are seated (although with reservation). The guacamole is out of stock (the worst for a so-called Mexican), the dishes where there should have been guacamole must be paid for in full, I ask the waitress what other ingredient they can replace the guacamole with or I imagine that Will there be a small discount on dishes without this ingredient? She goes to find out and comes back 20 minutes later! Saying that it doesn't change the price and that they don't replace guacamole, and that ""there's not enough in the dish to make a discount anyway"" üòÖ Staff who do not know the menu and are unable to advise you, no warning about the strength of the dishes ordered for children, 2 desserts out of 4, no professionalism, the customers are numbers. We rush you, and at the end we suggest you pay the bill by flashing the QR code on the table to avoid waiting in line, without specifying that this service is chargeable. A great scam, this Tiger Milk.",247
1.0,902nata1r60220,November 4 2023,1,"As soon as you arrive, you are informed that you have 1 hour 15 minutes to eat and that the dishes will all arrive at the same time so you will eat them lukewarm. The waitresses rush you throughout the meal and it's stressful. Nice decor but the concept is not at all successful. The dishes are good, but there is not enough room for all the plates since the tables are very small. At the end, the waitress tells you that you have 10 minutes left and that you will have to vacate the table! So, we were still hungry but we couldn't order the rest or the desserts. We took them elsewhere and it‚Äôs a shame! We didn't have a good time and wouldn't recommend unless you are in a very, very hurry..",247
2.0,Cestmoi69100,November 3 2023,15,"The place is magnificent, but the rest is not up to par! The dishes are tasteless. The service is terrible!! Long wait. The waitresses are very nice but completely incompetent! We ordered white wine but they didn't have any chilled so they put it in the freezer! And we never had a wine glass to drink from, despite our repeated requests: they ran out of them and were waiting for other customers to finish their glasses to bring them to us. After almost an hour of waiting, they brought us 2 (there were still some missing!), coming out of the dishwasher, hot and not dried. We ask for extra chips and tortillas, and they take the bowl of guacamole lying around on our table to put the chips in without even cleaning it! The most basic codes of the service are very far from being applied! Please, decor isn‚Äôt everything! Train your staff!!",247
2.0,Emma,November 13 2023,237,"A pretty and trendy place. The chairs are not very comfortable and the tables are too high which gives us the impression of being ‚Äúlow‚Äù compared to the table. The waitress spilled our guacamole on the table, then got the wrong dish for one person at the table which meant we had to wait and ate cold. The ceviche was pretty good but the pork tacos were bland and uninteresting. The portions of the sides (guacamole) are very small. So yes, this restaurant is very affordable but I won't go back, not worth the detour.",247
2.0,Marc,August 28 2023,5,"Tested on a Saturday evening at 9 p.m. with reservation. Very complicated to get a table, obviously the first service was not willing to release theirs. Passage by the bar to wait with a cocktail (very good and super nice bartender by the way!!). 1st attempt at placement in the ""speak easy"" room in the basement but unsuccessful because there was no room in the end so return to the bar üòÖ. By default, we are then placed right next to the toilets on a round table made for 2 but there were 3 of us (we will have to organize ourselves when the plates arrive!!). Given the noise level and the heat, I regretted the lack of space in the basement but perhaps the wait will be rewarded by the contents of the plate. Regarding the dishes, extremely surprised by the tacos that were way too spicy or a tasteless quesadilla, I had other memories of Mexican food. Let's move on to the carafe of water requested 3 times which due to lack of space on the table has anyway joined the decorative niche with books behind us. Really disappointed and it's a real shame because the place is quite nice with its very immersive decor, is very friendly and suggests a rather nice experience but the service could be improved that evening, the staff seemed overwhelmed by the crowd of the moment .",247
3.0,yoyo13700,March 4 2024,158,"We were a table of 11 adults including 1 sick... she asked for a coke, there was none, a plate of rice, there was none, she asked for a plate of plain Quinoa, which arrived cold and who will be charged the normal flat price.... a shame. Plus it was inedible. The setting is nice, the drinks are average, the lost brioche is very good, mixed opinion....",247
3.0,lapinblanc2016,December 13 2023,114,"But who are we kidding? Arriving at 12:30 p.m., the first dish was served at 1:49 p.m. and the last at 2:09 p.m. The dishes were cold. They were sent away. They came back lukewarm and the salad cooked. Two waitresses for such a room, but who are they kidding? Especially since they are responsible for collection. It's a shame, the place is beautiful and the map spiritual. Catering is far too serious a profession to be left to novices.",247
3.0,darkvador69,December 9 2023,156,"Very good decoration, super nice bartender. Good cocktails. Reservations required. A little wait in ordering. Too bad there was no more pork or beef at the start of the 2nd service at 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday.",247
2.0,M√©lina G,April 4 2024,1,Nice decor and pleasant atmosphere. Deplorable service provided by people who know neither the profession nor the menu nor the dishes‚Ä¶ starter and main course served at the same time‚Ä¶. So you have to eat the main dish first if you want to eat hot. Table type eats standing up according to the waitress so narrow for six; no room to place six starters and six main courses‚Ä¶. Roasted Calabaza without flavor and without interest: half butternut with little garnish. Only the ceviche was ok. We went to have dessert elsewhere,247
2.0,FarAway787909,November 5 2024,16,"Don't order the ribs. You will only have four bites of meat for almost ‚Ç¨30. I couldn‚Äôt even cut half of these ribs with my knife, so I left half on my plate. My drink was not very strong either. I'm never coming back here.",247
4.0,tony2525,August 30 2023,71,"The place is really beautiful, you feel good there straight away. We ordered lots of dishes which we shared. Everything was very good. It may still lack a bit of Spicy to rediscover the flavors of Mexico. The value for money is there, it still needs a little more to make it truly perfect but we will come back with pleasure!",247
1.0,Oseborn,June 10 2024,20,FR: Flank: inedible. Cause: dish chosen due to the absence of indication of coriander on the menu. SURPRISE: the chimichurri sauce was customized with cilantro and covered all the meat. Result: the plate left as it arrived. Paid in full. This is the first time I have had to make a kebab after a restaurant. IN : Flank steak: inedible. Reason: dish chosen due to no mention of coriander on the menu. SURPRISE: the chimichurri sauce was customized with coriander and covered all the meat. Result: the plate was returned as it came. Paid for in full.

5.0,Pioneer527354,March 2 2024,1,"An exotic, colorful and very classy setting. We were lucky, we were able to find a place even without a reservation. We appreciated being able to talk to each other and get along despite the crowds. Thanks to the chef, we found ourselves really enjoyed the fresh produce and just the right amount of spice. Thanks to our server who was considerate and attentive. And thank you to the team for your good mood!‚òÄÔ∏è",247
5.0,Samuel  P,November 17 2023,2,"Absolutely, the exceptional culinary experience in this Mexican restaurant in Lyon was enhanced by Delphine's remarkable management.

3.0,Lucy C,October 22 2023,16,"We had reserved the basement for a team building of 21 people. Nice decor upstairs. Bad management/organization, the waitress did not receive instructions. Long cocktail waiting time, but good cocktails. The dish arrived before the starters to share and we had to ask for more starters. The dishes are good and well presented but sometimes spicy. I do not recommend this restaurant for groups.",247
2.0,Banjo,February 10 2024,651,"So-so. Yet another restaurant for Instagrammers. √† la big mama, less quality of food. We came to eat as a couple, our table of 2 was so close to the other 2 tables that we ended up talking with the couple sitting next to us. Very nice but not really the idea of a romantic evening! You have to move the table to sit down and do it again to go to the toilet üòñ. Uneven food, nothing crazy. It's all in the decor. I don't recommend!!",247
5.0,FarAway753263,December 18 2023,1,Tigermilk Mexican Restaurant offers an exceptional dining experience. The authentic flavors and variety of dishes make this place a must-visit destination. The warm atmosphere adds a pleasant touch to the whole. A perfect choice for a memorable evening.,247

I was able to dine in the ""hacienda"" area upstairs, with a bird's eye view of the main room and the magnificent bar. A joy to dine in such a setting. Thanks to the team for the service.

1.0,Valentin L,October 7 2023,48,"Bad experience. The place is super cool but the servers are lost and don't have the service codes. It's hot, very hot. Most dishes out of stock. Extremely long waiting time. Cocktails arrived after the main course. Very spicy dishes without any warning. Too bad because the concept is good and the food (apart from the chili) is good.",247
3.0,Olivier D,October 23 2023,579,"On arrival you are notified, you must leave by 8:30 p.m.-45 p.m. Ok but it has to follow behind! Reduced menu and already shortages... not much choice. It's simple, even too simple... The concept is not complete: the music does not fit with the Mexican decor. Please let us know when the dishes are spicy! And the obligation to pay through an app doesn't make you want to leave a tip at all.",247

3.0,Justine P,September 17 2023,113,"Magnificent restaurant, beautiful decor and superb bar. On the other hand, the dishes arrived cold after a very long wait.

3.0,May,February 23 2024,5,"The dishes are quite good, not very filling for some but the taste is there. However, during my visit I ordered a starter, a main course and a dessert. What a surprise to see that my starter was counted as a main course, a mistake by the waitress. So I found myself paying the price of 2 dishes and a dessert even though that was not what I had ordered. No action on their part even though the error was at the restaurant.",247

The flavors are pleasant and the atmosphere is beautiful. The service was a little long but an apology was made, so I guess it's not usual. I was placed right next to the toilet, too bad!

On a Sunday night it‚Äôs no mean feat in Lyon. And we found ‚ÄúTigermilk‚Äù, first of all you see this decor that takes you directly to Latin America, the team is young dynamic and smiling, good cocktail well worked, I advise you to take several small dishes like tacos with a weakness for ‚Äúpollo‚Äù served by two, guacamole which is just great as well as quesadillas, the fact of sharing and eating a little bit of everything breaks the codes and transports us tastefully. The plates are well worked and really top. Desserts are also good with passion tiramisu and homemade cheesecake ‚Äúdulce de leche‚Äù both. Don‚Äôt forget to take your mezcal shooter before you go!!

3.0,audrey7369,March 24 2024,228,"Very nice restaurant, pleasant staff, surprising service but which suits me and which is well explained in advance. Great ease of paying your bill online (provided you have a network at the back of the restaurant). The dishes are very very generous, difficult to have dessert. We did like the majority of the tables, we shared dessert. The preparation of certain dishes could perhaps be improved. The salmon ceviche is really excellent, the ribs very good and super plentiful, perhaps we should put a container to be able to put the bones somewhere. On the other hand comes the half butternut..... The stuffing is very good on the other hand we expected better in the preparation: a half butternut a little hollowed out, even if it means mixing with the stuffing. Because there we find ourselves with stuffing almost only in the seed hole and the rest of the butternut is lightly covered with this stuffing, which is disappointing. We end up with raw butternut without seasoning, uninteresting, which we leave on the edge of the plate, big waste... if this preparation is reworked perhaps we will use it again. We had guacamole as a starter, it was good but too bad there were pieces of unripe avocado in it. Finally dessert. We had something different than last time because the passion fruit tiramisu was a failure (cream which had contrasted with the acidity of the passion fruit). We opted for a slice of cheesecake which we really liked. To do again in a while.",247
