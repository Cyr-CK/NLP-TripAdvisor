4.0,food_enthusiast666,May 10 2022,89,"The Grand Refectoire was, as the name suggests, the refectory of the former huge hospital which has now been converted into a retail and food destination. The menu is small but very interesting. We both had asparagus as a started served with a yoghourty dressing and chopped hard-boiled eggs with herbs - delicious.  This was followed by and unusual octopus and black rice stew which was perfectly cooked. Service was prompt and unobtrusive, and even with two glasses of wine as an apertif, then a pot of a decent Cote de Brouilly we got away under 135 euros. A very impressive space and well worth putting on your itinerary,",8
4.0,Susie_east_horsley,January 11 2020,4,We were recommended to visit this beautiful building however the food was a little disappointing given the very heavy price tag! Nothing was outstanding except the wonderful attention /service by Rosie who made our whole evening. It was middle of the week but first day of the sales so we expected it to be a little more busy. Huge cavenous space that would welcome the buzz of more people to bring it alive. Sad to say we would not rush back as there are so many restaurants offering better food and better value for money.,8
4.0,Andrea G,January 8 2024,1,"It has been a long time that I wanted to try this restaurant. The place is very nice. The location is very characteristic as the old refectory of the Hotel de Dieu was nicely renovated. It is very nice place. The place is very popular (as it should) and it is better to make a reservation (like we did) especially if you want to eat after 20.15-20.30. On my opinion, this is one of the major limitations of the place as it gets very busy and you are forced to call the waiters to order your food. It is not that the waiters ignore you, they are just very busy running from one table to another. In addition, you can feel that the place is very popular from the quality of the paper of the menu, which I found it worn and creased from overuse. Regarding the food, it was good and in line with the quality that you can find in Lyon (which is very high), the quality/price ratio was ok for Lyon (entree/plat/dessert = 39 euro). Despite the waiting time for the order, the food is very quick to arrive as the kitchen seems very well organized. The dessert was very good.",8
2.0,dmacseoin,February 28 2023,47,"We did arrive 25 minutes late which is understandably upsetting for staff and organisation. However being remonstrated about this by a very unfriendly receptionist on our arrival was quite astounding. To be accused directly of « impolitesse » was quite unexpected. Our reservation had been cancelled despite it being confirmed twice. There was no problem as the restaurant was quite empty and only filled up partially later on. I had been to this restaurant a week previously and due to the very positive experience was looking forward to introducing a friend to my new discovery. It is worth pointing out that during the week I had spoken to another friend who had had a very negative experience in the restaurant the same week I was there. We were there midday they the evening. To get back to this evening, the reception did nothing to put me in the right frame of mind to enjoy the meal. However it was not the only reason. The burata ordered by my companion was tasteless and stodgy. The lentil salad was good. We both had the st jacques which was basically two pieces of St Jacque with some potato pieces placed on a cold endive. The bread requested at the same time as the starter arrived eventually after the main course was finished. Personnel apart from the reception were friendly but quite dispersed and inefficient.",8
1.0,Arrt94,April 15 2024,75,"I regret not sharing the favorable opinions regarding this restaurant, dark and sad. We had a very bad experience. The waiter, otherwise smiling, was completely incompetent. We were served a tab without even asking us the desired cooking and we had, after a very long waiting time, meat that was practically raw and inedible. To judge the level of service, our two table neighbors were served dessert TWICE… before having the starter and main course ordered. It's not expensive, it's not worth more and it's a shame for Lyon's restaurants. To flee !",8
2.0,Mobile05985913619,February 19 2024,1,"The setting is magnificent but unfortunately there were many errors in customer care and service which disappointed us. When we arrived, despite a big smile from one of the people at reception, the rules of decorum were somewhat timid. No information on the fact that the menu was different compared to the proposals on the website. Namely: A unique Valentine's Day menu excluding drinks and expensive (65€/person), a limited choice on the menu whereas the restaurant was supposed to offer starter + main course + or main course dessert options at 36€ or 39€ for starter , dessert dish. The first waitress simply seated us, handed over the cards without specifying. In addition, when my friend wanted to order crozets from her and my dish, she was not able to confirm to us whether or not there were these left in the kitchen and to tell us beforehand that the pasta had been replaced by gnocchi. Another waitress was responsible for making our choices, the first having taken too long to return. These kinds of details should be known well in advance. Our dishes were good but the taste qualities did not appeal to us that much. Also lack of little attention to customers, even if only “Is everything going well for you? » or “Do you need anything else? »… The team seemed cold to us, not very warm... Everything was quite expeditious, even our glasses barely had time to be finished before our table was cleared too quickly. In summary, there is a need for training which must be continued, improvements to be made to perpetuate the concept, to make it more human and less superficial than it is at the moment. A little more clarity needs to be corrected regarding the products also offered according to the services.",8
2.0,NorthStar526458,December 7 2024,1,"Apart from the exceptional place, the meals are of poor quality and not at all up to this place. It is a “tourist” brewery with basic food not even at the level of corks: in terrine starter of dry and rancid pâté, passable quenelle and dessert not at all corresponding to the menu announcement. The icing on the cake, given the exorbitant price of the bottles of wine, I order from the pitcher of 46 Cc a local wine (I am advertised Côté Rôtie billed at 54 eur or the equivalent of 88 eur the bottle of 75cc. The wine is served in a transparent glass bottle and I do not guarantee that we will Served me a vintage wine aop! And the maitre d’ did not want to hear anything except to offer me a coffee push which I declined. It’s borderline scam, but it’s the festival of lights and therefore an opportunity to trap tourists.... Your establishment is warmly recommended by the Michelin Green Guide: I will not fail to let them know so that they warn their readers. A Belgian customer you will never see again and who will not fail to advertise!",8
3.0,Gggflo,April 17 2024,91,"My darling introduced me to this place full of history! I loved We were well placed and installed in the refectory room... the only downside: the service, a little young and inexperienced - We felt a little rushed in the service and from the choice of our aperitif... Delighted to have spent time for a meal this Tuesday evening with my Darling in this very unusual place.. The menu remains original and I found my little happiness for my taste buds! however in terms of price, the menu remains consistent for a big gourmand at 39 euros but compared to the price of an à la carte dish, we offer you a dish for more than 30 euros... I recommend the place for its history!",8
3.0,Jean-Paul H,January 15 2024,4,"On the occasion of a birthday, we dined at the Grand Réfectoire, and I must say that after the first appetizer, which was delicious, we were very disappointed and even annoyed: if the cuisine, although a little disappointing if we take into account the reputation of the Chef, remains very good and of high quality, the place which benefits from an incomparable history and remarkable architecture, is very poorly presented value. But what is worst is the service which is deplorable, the servers do not communicate with each other, do not listen to the customer, do not follow the course of the meal, we are therefore forced to ask several people times the wine, water, arrival of dishes, etc. yet they are not overloaded with work, we see them chatting among themselves, laughing, taking all their time, ... Not a single gesture, except a little digestive to apologize for the dysfunctions, I'll stop there, I'll spare you the problems when establishing the quote, but quite frankly, there are a thousand places much better, more pleasant and which for the same price will give you a much better time, especially to celebrate a birthday (the restaurant didn't even make a small gesture to celebrate the 80th birthday of the person who invited).",8
2.0,legoffjeromesls,February 17 2024,17,"We went there during a visit to Lyon. Magnificent place. On the other hand, disappointment on the plate. 1. Evening of 02/17. The discovery menu has been removed as a special “Valentine’s Day Souvenir” menu. Some dishes from the discovery menu remain available but only at the à la carte price. No information when booking about this limitation. 2. The crozets risotto was replaced by a plate of gnocchi without warning either when ordering or during service. In the prawn dish with vanilla homrad head juice, we do not find any notes of vanilla. 3. Good desserts. In summary, major communication problem. Value for money well below expectations and claims.",8
5.0,Philippe J,June 25 2024,3,"Tasty dishes, a (very) accessible rate 26 € flat starter dessert at lunch, at this level of cooking and service, it is top. And a magical place full of history! In short, a Grand Restaurant, accessible to as many people as possible. Bravo!",8
2.0,Annie  S,September 16 2023,2,"I still don't understand how water was added to my friend's glass of white wine, I highly doubt that it was accidental How did a restaurant of your standard fall so low? Furthermore, we were disappointed with the quality of the dishes. As for the service we had to wait 1 hour after entering... I don't think I'll come back, it's a shame because the setting is pretty.",8
4.0,Armelle D,January 20 2024,1,"It was the first time and a dream for years to come and eat in this place. I took the starter/main course/dessert menu for 26 euros, and later, I saw that I had been charged 5 euros for dessert!! which gave me 23 + 5 = 29 euros my husband had the starter/main course menu for 23 euros, and preferred the cheese, the bill said 9 euros, and I still found it a little high!! 23 + 9 = 32 euros Well, a little disappointed for that, but otherwise the meal was nice.",8
2.0,Laure3369,June 16 2024,2,"Value for money not at all up to par with the place… very long service. (More than 2 hours for appetizer, main course, dessert at lunch) Error in ordering the aperitif and cocktail consisting mainly of ice cubes. The menu advertises salmon with artichokes. We are served salmon with eggplant without informing us. The waiter comes back twice to take the order for the coffees, two of which were spilled... when we are asked how our lunch went and we point out the time and the problem with the dish, not a word of apology barely an “ah, we didn’t tell you about the dish…”. Not professional at all. A real disappointment!",8
2.0,Lisa-Maree H,October 19 2024,3,My daughters and I ordered the steak medium and requested beans and potatoes as extras. I ordered the pork because the menus was so limited and I don't eat steak. The meal was not good. The steaks were so rare my daughters couldn't eat their meal and my pork was tough. The waiter didn't come near us to pour our wine and the whole experience left us sorry we dined here.,8
5.0,Frank M,November 5 2024,3,"We were pleasantly surprised during our visit to Lyon by the location Grand Hôtel Dieu. Especially of the way in which a historic building can get a perfect current interpretation.  In doing so, we discovered 'Le Grand Réfectoire': a special location that attracted us just by being able to observe the activity in the kitchen from the outside. The reservation of a dinner went very smoothly online. It is particularly smart to spread the guests at reception per 15 minutes. We did see long lines at many other restaurants. The reception was rather cool and could be a little more exuberant by French standards. But that was more than made up for by dinner, a tasting menu in 3 courses. The wine chosen was perfect.  Needless to say, the location itself also made the whole thing very special. All for a very correct price. So, those who want to spend an evening in Lyon with a dinner that strongly resembles the big names and stars know where to go.",8
3.0,mcmicha,January 13 2024,2,"Nice place. On the other hand, I find that the servers do not present the lunch menus well. I didn't understand that there were 2 menus and ended up with a dish of scallops without dessert and we paid very expensively. In addition, the quantity is minimalist, it is excessive. Next time I will pay more attention to the menus. Too bad the servers don't draw attention to these 2 menus.",8
2.0,Fran D,October 9 2024,101,"First of all the restaurant is very large, with bland decor. Not at all what I expected from a Michelin or from the historic ancient building. Our first waitress was shy and lacked confidence therefore when we asked for a Cote du Rhone, she recommended a wine but it turned out to be a Beaujolias. We tried to drink it but it was sweet and fizzy, so we asked another server to please replace it and she kindly did so. Then the starter was good but lacked any ingenuity. The main plat was pork loin. The small portion arrived lukewarm at best and loaded with fat. The sauce was unremarkable. the accompanying vegetables were both white (endive and fennel) and both lacked any flavor, in fact the fennel tasted burned. We did not eat them beyond one taste. We ordered one lemon shortbread desert which was good. I must add that given the very large dining area, the restaurant attracts very large groups of tours (groups of 15-20 people at 3 different tables). These people are loud and the ambiance is decidedly not what we love about France, which is a small bistro with intimate dining that feels personalized. Our second server was wonderful, she was confident, well informed and efficient. Thank God for her!!!",8
3.0,Eva G,January 18 2024,1,"Disappointing... Unfortunately poorly trained staff, who misunderstand the ingredients present in the dishes from customers and familiarities. Unfortunately it is not worthy of a Michelin restaurant. A bit of the feeling of having simply financed the framework. Damage...",8
3.0,vd70000,December 24 2023,7,"The Grand Réfectoire is an impressive place steeped in history, with a bistronomic reputation. Despite the advice of an acquaintance who had a mixed experience there recently - due to a question of service - we decided to try it for ourselves. After booking online and duly reconfirming the reservation, when we arrived our table was not available and we found ourselves alone at the very back of the restaurant. With the card in hand (2 cards for 4), we were able to order. The starters arrived in a reasonable time and the quality was very good. Then we were forgotten for more than half an hour, we had to beg for dishes, a bottle of water, bread and wine, which had not been reserved and left on another table. The dishes arrived shortly after, the quality was correct, the bread “being cooked” arrived when our dishes were finished, and cold… Magical, not only is it made immediately, but it is immediately refrigerated so that the we don't get burned. Dessert and coffee, the coffee arrived well before dessert, in short. Our server was very friendly, we don't blame him, but the general organization really leaves something to be desired. At the checkout, we express our dissatisfaction, the person offers to offer us (finally) coffee. 2.5€ on an addition of more than 200€. What to say..?! A reputation not really deserved...?! We won't be back for a while.",8
1.0,Iveta A,September 10 2024,1,"Horrible food and horrible service. I waited one hour for a salad (6 pieces of tomatoes and burrata cheese) while my friend’s starter arrived 40 min earlier. When I asked if they forgot my salad they brought it to me and said “here is the salad, what is the problem”. They then served me uncooked pigeon. And by uncooked I mean, I dont even think it was heated or cooked at all. I sent it back and they “cooked” it by frying it on one side only and splashing the meat back in my plate. No apology, no nothing. I sent it back without eating any of it and they charged me for it at the end! Horrible three hour experience with horrible staff and even more horrible food.",8
3.0,arnaud C,September 24 2024,1,"The friendly place/setting A little disappointed about the quality of the service on small things (see a waiter filling an e bottle with a cubi,...) but which compensates with a nice attention of the service that put candles on dessert for our wedding anniversary specified for information at the Reservation. Mixed review on the menu: you don't go out with an OUAH, but with one it was mixed; untasteful tomato starter but good sausage starter; not very tender spine dish, rather fatty meat and vegetables too crunchy and lacking in something that wakes up but salmon dish and very good accompaniment; very good lemon dessert; very good white wine from the large dining room. Rating of 50€/person: ok but we could expect better from a cooking point of view with a big gap with other Lyon restaurants. This is the frame we pay for. We will recommend for the place but we will stay on ""you will judge for yourself"" on the kitchen. There is not much missing to allow this table to become an OUAH. Message of encouragement. ++ for the table in front of the kitchens - if I had known I would have booked this little atypical thing but if I understood what I was told at the reception on leaving, it is only on phone call and not on the site...",8
4.0,julien b,March 18 2024,3,"Lunch on a Saturday in the large refectory. Very good service. Lunch on a Saturday noon: 1 single menu for €29 and less, no à la carte dishes but even a few suggestions. On the other hand, the service was long, but long...arrived around 12:10 p.m., we left around 2:30 p.m....",8
3.0,aurel69lyon1978,December 5 2023,4,"The meal was good but the service disappointing. We had to request our dishes (starter, main course, cheese, dessert) one after the other as well as knowing who was going to serve us. I came several times and noticed that if you come as a group of 2, the service does not follow, the waiters are systematically focused on the large tables.",8
3.0,Claire S,February 16 2024,2,"The meal was good, and the setting pleasant. On the other hand, the service is a little... disjointed. We had at least 4 different servers, who did not coordinate with each other, we came twice to take our order, 3 people offered us the wine list (even though we ordered wine from the very first no one came), the service of our dishes was always ""express"", the young man placed our dishes at the table, without any explanation. And again for dessert, we wait, two people offered us a coffee, then another person asks us what we are waiting for... and our dessert ends up arriving, without any other presentation. In short, a rather decent moment, but nothing more.",8
3.0,Astrid P,November 30 2023,1,"The service was extremely long, 25 minutes to bring a carafe of water after being seated and 45 minutes to take our order. This set the tone for how slowly our food arrived despite a room that was not full. In terms of the dishes themselves, the starters were original and interesting in taste, however there was no flavor on the accompaniments to the main dishes (eg: gnocchi boiled in water with beef cheek, etc.). We haven't gotten ahead with the desserts. Room staff not very pleasant or smiling. A little disappointed with this establishment distinguished by a Michelin plate.",8
3.0,Florence F,November 15 2023,2,"The place is absolutely magnificent but the service a bit catastrophic. Many young waiters who come and go in the room or chat at the bar and we don't know if they understood the order and/or if they transmitted it because nothing happens. Despite the lack of crowds, we had to ask for dessert four times (even though it was requested when taking the order). Not to mention the coffee requested from several waiters who say yes and go elsewhere without having asked the bar to prepare it…another unpleasant surprise with the menu which is almost illegible (completely faded print) and you discover with the addition that the prawns make part of a menu other than the basic one. A shame because the place, steeped in history, is sumptuous.",8
3.0,Guillaume D,October 25 2024,1,"The cocktail and the dishes are very good. But what a pity that the pace of the meal is not spoiled by the length of the service. Waiting for nearly 30 minutes between each course is too long, as for the ""protein supplement"" says the waiter in my neighbor's salad, it is a red card for cooking and serving. Anyway I don't think I'll come back to it even if it's the dishes are tasty.",8
1.0,louseer,February 6 2024,5,"We priced 2 menus at 62 euros, the main course arrived really too salty. We sent it back and it came back also salty. We can all make mistakes, particularly in the salting, but sincerely the chef has no idea at all. been pro. Sincerely",8
1.0,Jean-claude M,January 12 2024,2,"Lyonnais/es, this is not the first time that we have lunch at the G Réfectoire. Lunch this Friday 12/01 was an ordeal. The accompaniment to the table was cheerful like a guard directing a prisoner to his cell. The pasta dish was cold, insignificant and tasteless. The glasses of wine ordered contained little more than a tear of red wine. The most difficult thing was going to the toilet, dirty, with a persistent smell of pipes in the corridor running alongside the kitchen, accentuated by the moss covering the wall. Only the service of the young people serving the dishes was correct. Poor food, small portions, lack of hygiene characterize our January experience.",8
3.0,Christophe C,October 24 2023,12,"The setting is very beautiful, the food is quality without being unforgettable, even if the quality/price ratio is very good. The wine list lacks choice in my opinion. The big disappointment with this dinner comes from the service which was really below expectations for an establishment of this type. A young team who didn't seem to know how to do it, who clearly lacked training, too bad... This is the second time I have dined in this restaurant, the first time left me with better memories.",8
3.0,Romain T,November 13 2023,6,"The dishes are good and well presented, with a short menu which is always a good sign! The place is also magnificent in the setting of the Hotel Dieu. However, the first evening service is more than hasty, even unacceptable for an establishment of this type, in order to make way for the second service at 9:30 p.m. Dishes and desserts literally followed one another with barely time to breathe. As for the bill, it doesn't take long to come either. Refectory atmosphere…!",8
5.0,Emmanuelle A,June 11 2024,1,"We had a family dinner in this magnificent, very well restored room. The service was very friendly and attentive, the dishes delicious. The menu is very reasonably priced, very good value for money. Large, well soundproofed room, we can hear each other talking!",8
3.0,Léonore P,January 23 2024,1,"The place is superb and atypical and worth discovering but it’s a shame that the service is not up to par. The staff is young, not pleasant or professional.

4.0,Carlos H,January 11 2024,2,"Breathtaking setting, impeccable service worthy of a gourmet restaurant.

4.0,Pierre G,January 24 2024,1,"We spent a very lovely evening at the Grand Refectory. On the ""Discoveries"" menu, cuisine full of finesse and elegance, which achieves a beautiful balance between simplicity and sophistication, which is not always the case, including among certain very (too) publicized ""chefs"". The service is impeccable, fast and attentive, but we feel these young people are so focused and diligent that they sometimes forget to smile. Compared to the high standard of the table, the amount of the bill is quite reasonable. As for the frame, it is simply... impressively beautiful! Two small drawbacks: a small plate for each guest who would avoid putting their bread on the table or on their plate would be welcome and the unpleasant smell which reigns in the toilets is surprising in such a beautiful and refined setting. But... we will certainly come back to taste the ""Marcel"" egg and the other great promises on the menu! Pierre G.",8
2.0,Jutois,May 12 2024,3,"The place is incredible, including the Hôtel Dieu and the large refectory. On the other hand, what a disappointment for the food. The starters (salmon marinade and herb-crusted st Marcelin), the main course (scallops), the mini portion of cheese or the dessert (chocolate cream with spices) nothing up to the level of the signature of a chef two stars. Either without flavor (salmon no taste, St Marcelin no taste😅), or too pronounced (maracuja velouté too acidic, dessert spices losing the taste of chocolate). We left the restaurant disappointed, as did our table neighbors. After comments, the head waiter kindly gave us a 15% discount on the menus.",8

4.0,Grégory N,September 1 2023,133,"Fantastic place, attentive staff. Very good overall, good experience. Only 1 downside which tarnishes the experience: we had taken 2 discovery menus (starter+main course+dessert) for €39, and asked if it was possible to change the desserts. Please note that the desserts offered on the menu are à la carte and that all desserts (except one) are at the same price, €9.50. The response being positive, we had another dessert (excellent by the way!), but in the end we were billed for a discovery menu, starter, main course at €36 + €9.50 for dessert....it's a shame .",8
3.0,Alexa C,December 4 2023,1,"The service was not up to standard, we had starters and had to ask twice for our glasses of wine to be served to us (which we had ordered at the same time as the rest). We took the menu back from the market, the velouté was not very hot and the starter with herrings and lentils was ok but nothing more (why put diced fresh tomatoes in this season?). The dish was good although a little too sweet between the potato and pomegranate molasses. The black currant ivory mousse was excellent. We had asked to have coffee with dessert but had to ask 2 waiters again.",8

And the food absolutely disappointing for such a beautiful place and for this price!!! a very small and soft pie with a sprig (literally) of salad and unseasoned Jerusalem artichoke. the dough is clearly a supermarket shortcrust, no crisp, no material in the mouth.. the main course, a plaster of dough with some tetragons (a kind of spinach) a unique mushroom cut in 4 and no vegetables.. All this for 36 euros!!! scandal, we are better fed for 15 euros in a good Vietnamese or Thai restaurant...",8

2.0,Sylvie J,November 5 2024,1,"very disappointing dinner. The monkfish dish was very bland and dry, the vegetables that accompanied it were not cooked? It's still very surprising.

5.0,Eugénie T,November 19 2024,1,"Very good experience. This is my second meal there, and the food is still as good and the waiters are nice. The only negatives are the noise in the room and the temperature which may be a little low to the tastes of some, nevertheless the size of the room makes it difficult to solve these problems. This does not change the quality of service and food! Another significant point is the reasonable price of the menu and the choices offered, which allows to have a satisfied table regardless of the budget or diet.",8
3.0,pascale T,December 7 2024,5,"A large noisy and cold refectory. Here nothing is cosy, the plates are laid on the melamine table (no tablecloth, no table set). The products are fresh but unsurprising cooking, quite bland., kept warm probably long minutes before being served. As for the service... we must slow down the waiters who clear the glasses or plates before they are finished. Obviously they couldn’t wait to go home...so could we! In short no finesse, just a large refectory.",8
3.0,Michele K,September 16 2024,1,"Absolutely delicious cuisine! But huge downside on the service: 1. We had booked in advance. When we arrived, the restaurant room was almost empty but we were placed next to the water bottle bar .. lots of passage and the location was really not nice 2. We ordered a large beer (500mL), a small one was served to us (300mL): a large one was charged to us 3. We ordered 1 3-course menu and 1 2-course menu: 2 3-course menus were charged to us 4. 1 of the plates in which we were served the entrance had a large jug (piece of porcelain missing on the edge of the plate). As regards points 2 and 3, we realised this at the time of settlement. Obviously, the manager corrected the bill. Too bad to go to a good restaurant and have to be vigilant about what happens on the table",8
3.0,Augustin T,October 9 2023,43,"A very beautiful room, very spacious Overall we ate well The value for money is correct I would have liked more puff pastry for my mille-feuille However, the service is quite long, and the taste of the wine did not inspire confidence at all.",8
2.0,Raffyk,November 3 2024,14,"Room manager stressed and who makes you feel good, pompous service all the same balanced by the kindness of the young waitresses, all augmented by the solemn side of the place: all this does not make you feel comfortable in this place. It’s a shame because the place is worth the visit. When it comes to cooking, quality and quantity are confused in the menu. In short, a big disappointment.",8
5.0,Lynn_Taiwan,November 4 2024,8,"I asked friends to come for the menu ""Saturday lunch"" including starter, main course and dessert for 29 €. The place is very spacious, the menu is good quality. The service is very good and not snobbish. It's a nice surprise. I highly recommend it.",8
4.0,Julie S,December 20 2023,1,"Very nice discovery! Pleasant atmosphere in this historic Lyon location. We took the menu for 39 euros. The dishes were perfectly presented, haute cuisine! The only downside was the lack of coordination between order taking and the bar and kitchen because our dishes arrived before the aperitif. We sent the dishes back, reporting this little hiccup. Too bad for a restaurant of this quality and reputation.",8
4.0,Jean-David L,November 19 2023,1,"A magnificent room which is bustling (a little too much...) but a very pleasant welcome and service, smiling, charming, attentive and professional. The dishes are exquisite with a multitude of flavors. A big thank-you. The icing on the cake... the young man at reception even remembered that we were celebrating our leather wedding anniversary. And thank you also to the charming young woman who served us our desserts surrounded by a candle.",8
3.0,Cruiser33726331888,December 10 2023,1,"The service is very organized, there is never a wait, the sequence is precise. We ate well, the dishes are original, but also special. The room is very, very noisy. We took a bottle of wine, the bottle was not on our table but with the waiters on another table, we had to constantly ask them to be served. We did not like this method. It was nice and worth doing once because the place is magnificent. But we won't come back.",8
1.0,Audrey S,December 11 2024,1,"It was catastrophic. From starter to dessert. We ordered a pie that was cold-ish but at the same time soggy and dry on its sides… replaced by a lentil soup, good but not special. The main arrived cold for the 3 of us, we even wonder if it was supposed to be served cold as it was cold like cold from the fridge. Of course poultry and cod need to be served warm. At the end they forgot to serve one dessert, we have to remind them. We politely mentioned the multiple issues, they offered the coffees to apologise. Leaving the table we had to queue nearly ten minutes to pay the bill at reception. A moment that was supposed to be nice that ended being irritating and very very disappointing.",8
5.0,Ruben,February 13 2024,1,"This is the second time I have come to dine at Le Grand Réfectoire, and I still love the atmosphere of the place as well as the kindness of the servers. Their dishes are always very delicious and super well presented. The prices are also very affordable given the quality of the dishes. I recommend this restaurant with my eyes closed!",8
4.0,Julie T,August 6 2023,1,"This restaurant is located within the grounds of the Grand Hôtel Dieu de Lyon, renovated by a great architect Jean Philippe Nuel, it seems to me! So it’s already worth the trip! Lol! Then, the welcome and the service are there. The staff is both discreet and attentive, doing everything possible to meet our expectations. The dishes served are tasty, made with quality products. The only downside would possibly be the rather austere and a little cold setting...it's not very warm... But it's probably the monk-like style that wants that...a good table in any case ...",8
1.0,Elmuth,April 20 2024,16,"We give you a different flavor of dessert than the one ordered and you have nothing to say! And what’s more, with seasonal fruits, even green ones! waitress and superior who don't care cobwebs on the stained glass windows at eye level, A magnificent place with lousy catering and service! We won't set foot there again",8
4.0,YVES DB,December 17 2023,112,"Very nice place, it's very good, even if the portions are not huge and in particular for the main course. Saturday evening menu at 39€ with starter + main course + dessert. Efficient and discreet staff. There is a formula for €79 with 3 starters, 3 main courses, 3 desserts and the table and IN the chef's kitchen. The only weak point of this restaurant... the toilets are really very dirty already in the early evening (8 p.m.). There is progress to be made there, too bad.",8
5.0,Fabien C,November 5 2023,3,"This Grand Refectory is located in the large room of the Grand Hôtel-Dieu hospice in Lyon. The room is not super hot (female opinion, this first cool and rainy Saturday) but the atmosphere is. What we had on the plates was very beautiful to see (very elaborate) and delicious to eat (all the dishes have a special touch; that of the Chef). The staff took great care (like in a very large house). Just less than €100 for two! As a bonus, through a small corridor, you can watch the cooks in action, it's magical.",8
2.0,Sarah P,October 5 2024,52,"After 3 weeks of dinners in Lyon, sad to say that this ranked as the worst. Food was actually mediocre (not bad, not good) but it was the service that ruined the evening. Low energy and extremely inattentive, I honestly have nothing positive to say. This evening epitomized the premise that service can make or break a restaurant ... in this case, it broke it.",8
5.0,Isabelle P,July 2 2024,1,"We were 6 people to discover the discovery menu that enchanted us (lentil and octopus salad: what a delight!) We just regretted not being able to enjoy Maurice Ravin's signature egg and some dishes offered only in the evenings. We had a great time, without any pressure from the staff, despite our late booking 14:00! We will come back one evening to taste this egg and the other dishes on the menu that tempt us.",8
2.0,doche,April 26 2024,10,"Very very disappointed…..we had already eaten several times in this restaurant which was quite good. On the other hand, this Thursday lunchtime the three dishes ordered were disastrous in terms of quality/price. Heavy cuisine, vulgar product, cold dishes and restaurant temperature also cold.. This restaurant should recover quickly!",8
5.0,DavidMouzet,August 30 2023,2,"Setting steeped in history and perfectly presented, warm, attentive waiters (waiter with superb 1930s mustache and attentive waitress), smiles, friendly, attentive, efficient. Tastefully prepared plates and dishes with remarkable flavors. THANKS. We just need to improve the intensity of the lighting or the size of the letters on the menus a little…I didn’t have my glasses😀",8
3.0,Freedom11474711307,September 22 2024,1,"Beautiful setting, beautiful decoration that harmonizes and enhances the authenticity of the place. The meal was good, the starters are very simple but the main course and dessert are very good and well presented. However, more than 25 minutes to wait, without even a carafe of water, before someone comes to bring us the map and this, on our request (I think otherwise we would still be there!). Once the menus were in hand we had to wait again to be able to place our order and have water.... The wine service was also a great moment.... The starter and the dish were served to us in a reasonable time. Desserts, so here we go again on a sketch... we waited again, waiting, to believe that we had been forgotten... following our request 2 desserts were brought and again we waited for the remaining 2. The only moment when miracle there was a revival of energy and speed was to bring us the bill and unfortunately it was absolutely not correct. It was brought to us when we had not asked for anything and we had just finished dessert! If we had wished to have a digestive, coffee or other this was apparently not possible. It is to be asked (we have nothing against the moment we are warned) if this was not the first service of a hotel school... Too bad it was a failed experiment.",8
5.0,Michael M,September 14 2023,2,"The setting in a historic building, beautifully refurbished, is remarkable. The food was very interesting and distinctive, without being quirky, and, most importantly, it was delicious. There was a very good list of reasonably priced wines. The service was very good. It was easy to book online. It was a very memorable experience.",8
3.0,Joel M,May 5 2024,1,"beautiful building, large room too noisy (too promiscuous with the other tables). The waiter who brings you the wine before the champagne as an aperitif. ????The meal is good and plentiful. Epic moment to pay the bill and make deduct the amount from our gift voucher. And the bouquet, for a restaurant which may be the top of the basket, the passage to the toilet, the nauseating smell which could have made us give up our dinner. A culinary experience that delighted us has become a fiasco, not ready to see us again The Grand Refectory (not that big)",8
4.0,fab92,December 25 2023,92,"The interest of this restaurant lies primarily in its architecture. As in all bistros, the tables are so close to each other that two-person conversation is complicated. The staff is very young and lacks a little experience but let's not stop there, they have the merit of wanting to do well, let's let them learn. Quality food, price a little high but hey we are not disappointed. My husband had the bad idea of having cheese and at least 20 minutes to get his plate in which 3 unfortunate pieces were hiding under the salad. It's an unmissable place in Lyon.....",8
2.0,Laurent D,November 2 2024,46,"Great disappointment but, yes a great dining room .. actually Big yes, refectory, not so much it makes it and that’s why we got caught. Too bad. Disappointment from the beginning with a Negroni that announced the color of the rest, namely: no heart, no soul! There are dishes, maybe recipes, but neither chef nor kitchen, at best it looks like a great (by the capacity of numbers , not by the talent or the desire to share a know-how ) caterer or plates are sequencing, the white wines are iced, the toast (toast) cold too Flower cabbages have good cooking but the three poor Saint Jacques are more than mediocre (but it is true that after they have left the freezer, their cooking becomes complicated ) I'll pass you the rest except, a frozen nougat with earth pistachios, do you know the earth pistachios? Me, I discovered, the other name of peanuts!!  In summary, a professional room staff ensures the work But an address to avoid",8
3.0,Isabelle J,September 11 2024,1,"I usually book with you for business dinners , and I really appreciate the setting which is generally cozy with a very good Value for Award . Yesterday we wanted to celebrate a family event but there were 2 large groups very noisy and the dishes less tasty than usual (it seems to me) . Next time perhaps you can warn if you privatized your restaurant room for a large group in order to possibly postpone our coming. The monastery room is too sound to mix groups. well to you Isabelle Jamet",8
3.0,Evgenia O,March 11 2024,9,"The environment is very pleasant, the service is fast and polite. The food was a bit disappointing, namely the marinated shrimps (the plate was beautifully decorated but the texture and taste of the shrimps was odd), and mango/passion fruit mousse (very dense and too much sweet). However, want to come again to try dinner menus.",8
3.0,Pascal A,November 3 2024,1,"The setting is original and rather impressive. The service is very good. On the kitchen side, it's good, no reproach. On the other hand marked criticism about the quantity: even without being 'heavy eater', it is really light (3 medium sized scallops for the main course, we find it very chic). In summary, the value for money is quite satisfactory, the quantity for money ratio is frankly bad. Hence my average grade, after all.",8
2.0,Christine V,December 10 2024,13,The setting is beautiful but the food is not up to expectations. Half slice of terrine with sauce on top that removes all flavor. Same for undercooked fish drowned in sauce. Cute with Gourmet coffee passable Wouldn't come back,8
3.0,Georges R,November 6 2023,1,"Superb setting, quality welcome. Very satisfactory, attentive and adapted service. However, the wine could have been offered for tasting and then served. Menu at 39 euros: a sophisticated and successful presentation of the dishes, but banal and very average content. Overall, a poor quality/price ratio, more focused on appearances than on content.",8
3.0,Manon P,December 25 2023,1,"The place is magnificent, the atmosphere is peaceful and subdued. The service needs to be slightly improved, we ordered a wine and a cocktail which arrived after the starter. In addition, we waited for the dish 30 minutes after the arrival of the starter.",8
2.0,estelle r,November 16 2023,3,"Very disapointed. Unqualified staff, wine was spilled on the sleeve of one of the guests during service, hot dishes were served lukewarm. Far too expensive for the service. The icing on the cake, the person who collects the payment follows us outside, telling us that two shares out of the 7 have not been paid even though I had paid in cash. When I remind him, he returns to the restaurant without apologizing.",8
3.0,Dad D,March 3 2024,15,"the quality of the dishes has declined over time. A few years ago, much more attention was paid to details. I ate a chicken that was overcooked and very tough. The waiters and waitresses, all very young, seemed very tired. Damage.",8

Errors during service (dishes were brought to us from another table) Overall, very good dishes but a few errors (a foie gras not particularly suited to the menu, a rum baba without rum) On the other hand, very pleasant staff! The waiter took the time to explain to us how the house works and the production of homemade oil. It was really interesting.",8
3.0,Laurence P,December 1 2023,1,"This is the first time that I have been disappointed by the quality of the welcome and the service which no longer lives up to the quality of the dishes and/or in any case what it was until now 🤪😞. No one at reception, no one to seat you despite a confirmed reservation on your site, deplorable service. We really felt like we were disturbing, we had to ask for salt and pepper several times and we really had the impression of disturbing... that we weren't being listened to/heard... yet we had reserved for 2 p.m. and so there weren't many people at the table... and when it was time to pay at the exit, we waited a long time for someone to come and cash us!!! We could have absolutely left without paying!!! We were so “invisible!” We were the last table. We were absolutely not accustomed to this in the Refectory. Fortunately, we ate very well as usual.",8
4.0,EMER,June 10 2024,35,"We hesitated before booking in this magnificent place, the word refectory appealed to us a little as well as the number of tables lined up, how can we achieve a good level of cuisine in these conditions? Well we were pleasantly surprised, the meal being excellent a reminder of tradition with a touch of creativity, an unstructured but not disfigured tradition, we however reserved under the vaults of the cloister; the staff is smiling and attentive and in- apart from a small bug when booking which was quickly repaired, the evening was exciting, a small remark we would have liked a more cooked pork loin (it was raw!) which is not the recommended cooking method .",8
5.0,Emmanuel T,October 20 2024,2,We celebrated our daughter's 18th birthday there. An impeccable service for a large table of 11 people. The dishes were excellent subtle marriage between French and Caribbean cuisine. Special mention for the girl who took care of us all evening: only 3 weeks of service but very professional attention and a sense of service that is becoming increasingly rare. We'll be back!,8
4.0,Toudia I,January 26 2024,1,"First time eating in your restaurant. Charming, cozy and exotic place. Excellent welcome, pleasant and courteous waiters. However a little disappointed hence the 4/5. The main course was excellent but not filling enough. Two people next to our table had the same dish and we were surprised by their plates which were much fuller than ours. (Scallops with a real accompaniment for them). For 86 euros, our main course plates were very empty. Unfortunately, we are left hungry. A bit of a shame!",8
5.0,Valérie F,July 9 2024,3,"One might fear a certain coldness considering the imposing places full of history, but the renovation of the place perfectly combines History and modernity; the welcome is warm and friendly.

A very good time and place to recommend.",8

4.0,xavier m,June 2 2024,1,"Very warm welcome, attentive service, very good advice for wine (the Condrieu and the Saint-Joseph were great) The starters were delicious however the main courses were ruined by the lack of heat and the plates they were served on were also cold. The place is magnificent but tasting lukewarm or even cold dishes spoils the experience.",8
1.0,Chris S,July 19 2023,19,"Worse food that I had in france and no one cared. Ordered fixe menu at 36 euros. Green bean salad had a feeling of fat. On the beans which did not appear to be fresh.

4.0,Ann B,December 30 2023,20,"Beautiful area. Good menu, good fresh and well prepared products The only downside was an error on the menu and as a result the cheese was not the one offered, a change without warning from a luxury cheese to a plate of 2 ordinary cheeses. Neither apology nor commercial gesture, too bad.",8
4.0,Candice,August 24 2023,30,A very nice surprise to dine in this place steeped in history. Just the decorum leaves you speechless!

We will come back one afternoon to enjoy the terrace 😉,8
5.0,JL F,May 13 2024,393,"Very beautiful historic place - perfect welcome and service with the kindness of the waiters who made the effort to ask the kitchen for the possibility of ordering dishes which were only available in the evening...

3.0,pisco,November 21 2023,3,"This large refectory room is a magnificent place. A smiling service, for a slightly disappointing lunch. The quantities are insignificant, even nicely presented.

5.0,GYVON01,February 3 2024,274,Beautiful place Bar upstairs to start with romantic cocktails. No-frills restaurant. Discreet and efficient service. Given the volume of the room we feared it would resonate but not at all. The menu allows you to discover lots of dishes (well done to the chef and his team). The wine list is not huge but it avoids getting lost and the wines offered are excellent. For us it was a white St Joseph from Stéphane Montez. We recommend and will come back.,8
5.0,Bpm73,April 18 2024,493,"In an original and magnificent setting, this restaurant offers tasty cuisine. We opted for the menu option and enjoyed the scallops accompanied by polenta and the very good chocolate desserts. The service is smiling and attentive. A good place for a dinner for two.",8

It was perfect",8

Too bad the setting is magnificent.",8
2.0,Arnaud D,October 25 2024,1,"Cold welcome and professional limit. Regarding dishes, lentils with octopus as starter = very medium. The dish (pork skein or filet mignon, I don't know), portion a little congruous. Wine: St Joseph's jar: healthy Jo is one of my favorite wines, rarely drank a St Jo as bad. We had it replaced once, but with the same one (for 37€ anyway!) all for a high overall price. I'm not coming back.",8
3.0,Nicolai M,August 6 2023,2,"Great location, great atmosphere in a historic building. Service was good. The menu had its ups and downs, but overall it was too expensive for what was on offer.

Once we mentioned one was missing they brought it in the wrong order and invented a weird excuse ( but the worse is they forgot a plate and would had miss it if I didn’t complain).

Second bad experience with the aperitif since during a previous family meal on April 6, 2024 we had with our six aperitifs a small cup garnished with 4 tiny biscuits. Particularly embarrassing moment for our guests. An effort must be made in this area because we are particularly fond of this place which saw the birth of our children in its time.",8
3.0,Hej R,June 23 2024,2,"The place is beautiful authentic , excellent meal but the service was not up to the place. 1 aperitif menu for everyone: I had never seen this even in a basic restaurant inexperienced waiters / being taken away from me when I didn’t finish without wondering anything / dirty cutlery not changed Dirty toilets Too bad hence the 3",8
3.0,Christopher M,September 2 2024,4,"Servillete holed, slow service, then the waiter forgot the spoons. I asked him for some and he forgot again, finally I had to find another waiter to get spoons! Proper food but it doesn't deserve two Michelin stars, not even one. The noon shift is not up to the task (August 31, 2024).",8
2.0,Mmj,March 16 2024,2,"Exceptional settings in this hotel God!! But even if there were a lot of staff in the room: - staff not only do not take care of customers but do not even look at them - staff constantly travel empty-handed as if they were lost - reception just checks your reservation, brings you to the table and leaves you. No way to ask where the jackets should be placed… - the staff are gathered at the bar and talk a lot - the kitchen is uninteresting - the only one who worked non-stop is the barman In short, it seemed to us that the staff were students of a hotel school but without a head waiter who directed them, as if they were left to their own devices. A big disappointment. With such a framework there are ways to do much better.",8
4.0,Climber06560327021,October 11 2024,1,The service and meal were impeccable On the other hand the Beaujolais au glass was not good. We were told that it was impossible because it had been tasted in the morning and that next time we would have to take the roast side!!!! It was not at all a suitable answer in my opinion,8
5.0,Franckyz,February 20 2024,37,"It's not cheap, but we must admit that we eat well and that we are well served and that the welcome is very pleasant. The omnipresent smile.

4.0,stephanie c,April 22 2024,1,"Very nice place where you will be very well received, welcoming and smiling team. Visually the dishes are very beautiful and good. The only downside was that I reserved a collection menu with 2 glasses of champagne via the internet which were not included correctly in the final bill (even though it was clearly specified at the start of the meal). A little work to do on this side so that there are no (bad) surprises when paying the bill (the manager was very professional). I therefore recommend this establishment!",8
3.0,Mel,March 23 2024,2,Decoration and atmosphere not up to the photos on the website. Average service and we had the impression of being pushed out the door at 9 p.m. (arrival at 8 p.m.). Cuisine that lacks flavor and presentation. Maybe we had too many expectations. We will not return there.,8
3.0,Pauline A,November 19 2023,3,"There was a group of us at lunchtime. I had the boudin tart and the rigatoni, it lacked flavor. Error in the order when serving the dishes. Dishes served cold, we sent some back to the kitchen. Toilets with a dirty smell, putting perfume inside would have been welcome to mask this awful smell. Not worthy of an establishment like this. Very disappointing.",8
3.0,Amanda H,August 9 2023,10,"The environment is wonderful. The food was good, albeit, for my tastes, lacking in a little bit of seasoning. The service was slow. It took 15 minutes to get somebody to take our drinks order, and I almost had to beg! Not sure, perhaps short staffed.",8
4.0,acolombo66,September 27 2022,360,"The restaurant is in the wonderful Grand Hotel Dieu de Lyon and has a huge space with a modern and elegant ambience. The menu is rich, I had fish and was happy with my salmon. The dessert was very very good. I was a gues, so I have no idea about the cost",8
5.0,Vagner e Thais,March 1 2020,39,"Great way to arrive at Lyon. All the starters, bone marrow and the scalops were delicious. We went straight from the airport almost in time for the kitchen to close and even so, the service were very good and let us take our reasonable time. The specialty egg was specially good, with a lot of truffles. Both the lamb and the pork were also amazing. Some said it was a little heavy on the curry, but great for my taste.",8
4.0,Reto G,February 15 2024,3,"We had a magical evening. The service is fast, courteous and very competent. Marcel’s egg is an extraordinary culinary experience.

5.0,Franckies69,January 7 2024,25,The cuisine is perfect and the service is up to standard in this building steeped in history.

5.0,Eleanor D,January 12 2023,21,"We’ve eaten at this restaurant many times and the food are service have always been superb. At our table we mixed and matched the set menus with a la carte, and enjoyed everything. Cocktails and mock tails add to a decent wine list. Service is always top notch, even on a packed Thursday. Recommend reservations.",8
3.0,Thierry G,September 14 2024,63,"Sublime setting but disastrous service!!! Long wait before taking our order (we would have liked them to bring at least water). I'm passing the fact that I had to wait for a knife... Then I had to cancel the glass of wine I had for the meal that arrives once the main course is finished. Same thing right at the end, before dessert he brings back a bread basket? Brief inadequate service Too bad because the setting is really sublime and the dishes tasty (but in small portion)",8
3.0,FrenchInAsia,June 17 2021,128,"My fish wasn’t cooked. It had to be sent back to the kitchen but then I got a nice cooked fish. Portions are very Nouvelle cuisine, that means very little in your plate. Service is excellent however no special treatment to apologize for the raw fish! Café gourmand is also excellent yet tiny portions which is good for my diet!",8
4.0,Francois L,August 16 2024,54,"An atypical place with fairly dim lights. The kitchen is very good and the staff friendly. The service is too fast, we had the Impression of a time trial. If you are looking for a romantic place, it will not be the restaurant to choose, the dining atmosphere is really present, rather to favor for meals with family or friends.",8
3.0,Vincent,November 22 2023,154,We wanted to have a family meal to celebrate an occasion. In the end we were quite disappointed with the performance; - cocktail received with the dishes - dishes received just lukewarm - wine requested 3 times and received at the end of the dish... too bad the pairing would have been great - service time too long and disjointed It's a real shame because the staff is very friendly and the food is good. The place is really charming.,8
2.0,Doug C,February 16 2020,8,"4-course tasting menu. Main courses were good, but rest were so-so.  Terrible service. Served a stale dessert from the night before (Valentine’s Day).  Will not go back or recommend to anyone.",8
5.0,Laurent B,January 27 2024,2,"The restaurant is not that easy to find, in the maze of the Hôtel Dieu, and the entrance is not very prominent. The dinner (Collection menu) was excellent, the Amberjack Souskaï very surprising but excellent, the suite more classic. Pleasant and fast service, it is an address to recommend.",8
5.0,Karla Barros B,September 21 2024,27,"We highly recommend the experience at Le Grand Réfectoire! The food is delicious, well served and the price reasonable. Dinner menu (entry + dish + dessert): 39 euros. At lunch, the full menu is even more affordable: 27 euros. The environment is beautiful, quite sophisticated and the service is 5 stars. The only point to consider was the time for the drinks to reach the table. We thought there was a delay beyond the pleasant when the restaurant was full. The attendants seemed overloaded. We ended up having no drink at the table. But before we complained, the attendant noticed the fault and resolved it. I hope to have the opportunity to repeat the experience!",8
4.0,Bénédicte P,September 2 2024,1,We had a great time and our plates were as beautiful as they were good. We even had a super nice commercial gesture because the service had not been very fast. We were in no hurry so nice attention from the team. They care about everything going well. Award quality ratio is satisfactory. Top frame! I love it! Just the small improvement point would be to have a tablecloth rather than the bare table. I recommend. And will come back for the more elaborate evening dishes that I will have enjoyed well at lunch.,8
4.0,Isabel S,January 18 2024,4,"I really like this restaurant. Everything is perfect, except the toilets which have (since the opening of the restaurant) had a musty and sewage smell contradicting the quality of the restaurant. Please consider extracting the air!",8

In summary, the setting wins but it was still a good experience.",8
4.0,Frédérique E,April 8 2024,2,"Correct welcome, well-ordered service despite a little hiccup at the aperitif but quickly recovered, friendly staff. Good food. Some dishes would have deserved to be served hotter. Good value for money. This experience makes us want to go back.",8

4.0,Jean Paul R,May 24 2024,1,Very beautiful setting. Very attentive service. Even if sometimes hesitation to serve a dish or drink but not serious at all. Cooks well. Not enough Colombo sauce on the chicken or peanuts. Lack of character in my opinion. Perfect chicken cooking!,8
3.0,Maya M,September 16 2024,1,"The setting of the Hotel Dieu is friendly, beautiful atmosphere. The food was light, good. We waited 45 min for dessert, asked twice before having them... The room manager didn’t even come to apologize",8

3.0,Jean-François G,February 16 2024,7,"Excellent location within the Hotel Dieu in a magnificent setting. The restaurant room is steeped in history, as it was the refectory of the sisters of the care establishment. Upon entering, you have a clear view of the kitchen brigade. rather friendly welcome. For the lunch menu, it's simple and good. But I, who am not a big eater, found the quantities very insufficient. Very good to work on the decoration and the tastes, but there must still be something on the plate. Too bad to fall into this fault. This is why I only give 3 stars in my rating.",8
5.0,Amandine G,February 12 2024,3,A magnificent place with perfectly renovated architecture for a lunch with friends. The staff is impeccable and very pleasant. The menu is simple and well developed. The dishes served are delicious and well presented. We were won over! THANKS.,8

3.0,Valle A,August 1 2023,5,The meal was good but “nothing more”. The place is incredible but the cuisine doesn't necessarily make you want to come back if it's not in an exceptional place like this. It was good but we're still a little on the fence about the search for dishes & flavors We were a little disappointed The waitress doesn't know the wine list by the glass I know they are in training but that clashes with the standing.,8
4.0,Pinard-bertelletto,February 27 2024,1,Quality service and cuisine that lives up to its reputation. Very beautiful place and pleasant atmosphere.

3.0,Woodnorton1,September 9 2023,18,"It's been a few years since we last visited here. Lyon can spoil you. I have great memories. The location is steeped in undeniably French religious and Royal history.  Only this could allow it the excuse to have a German beer hall come school dining room feel. The menu is epileptic in layout. This can be an exciting explorative journey. However, not today. Hidden amongst a genuinely interesting menu are asterisks. Sadly, not the cartoon variety but that syntactical. They are small, discreet and explained in the smallest font at the bottom of the page. These great many gems are the dishes not available to those dining outside evening dinner time. My thought to management. Be kind. Print lunch only menus. Don't tease your guests. I'll crowd fund the printing costs for you if you so require. We all have bad days. Mine had become mediocre and I know this restaurant can excite me. I read the full menu. Starter was a good cheese and smoked bacon, two types, hazelnut salad. Despite the aged, limp, greens, I liked it. It didn't look fresh, but I liked it. The rest of my company didn't.  My two types of smoked bacon were all dark and piggy goodness. My companions, all of those having the same dish, got blanched white fat. Two types. I had the long strip of duck breast for main, sat in the middle of three pencil tip carrots, three small sluggish looking beetroots and half a mid sized potato with an over aired topping of, I think, cream and cheese. It really did look temporally tarnished. My knife had to be changed to something sharper or my otherwise rubber ducky was getting lucky and heading back to the kitchen. Dessert was a millefeuille with framboise support. Two types. It was now a theme. It was okay. Malheursement, je pense that the one I bought my wife in the Boulangerie this morning will be better. In such a competitive culinary city, I'm really disappointed. It's a lovely venue. The staff are very nice and given it's an easy to reach location, should be a first port of call.",8

3.0,Simon--Newton,August 4 2020,321,"Confusing menu - we all thought we'd been told that if we took the most expensive set menu we could have items off the cheaper set menu - that's what we thought we heard - but it all went A la Carte (or the expensive option!!!) when the bill came (we've lived in French speaking Europe since 2009). My starter seemed a mean portion - the type where the restaurant is trying to stretch the food further (Foie gras de canard) my main was Risotto de carnaroli / Calamar et gambas but the flavour? Bland and that's a compliment. The wines we chose were very good although the wine list has some jaw dropping prices! Yes, the setting is fantastic, a great venue as is the whole Grand Hotel Dieu redevelopment but that doesn't excuse the faults. Plus maybe a table cloth?

For dessert, a rum baba and tarte tatin, the rum baba had so much cream and had not the real baba texture...what a pity.",8

3.0,Loretta R,September 30 2019,191,"We had dinner here, and while the newly-renovated refectory building is stunning and provides a memorable setting, the food was at odds with what we were expecting from such rarified surroundings. Portions are huge and hearty - I only managed about half of my lamb dish, which was admittedly good (very tender, slow-braised meat in a rich gravy) and my husband struggled to finish his main. When we looked around and added up how many covers they have (when full, it must be over seventy), it made sense, though; much easier to anticipate supply with fairly basic, slow-cooked dishes than small, fiddly, labour-intensive plates. Front-of-house are professional and helpful, and the wine list is excellent as you might expect, but don't come here expecting an intimate, crafted dining experience (or a cheap one - our bill came to over 200 Euro without dessert.). It's really all about the setting.",8

The welcoming team very nice. It is big, maybe too big? It offers a bar for nights drinks or for waiting customers, a winery area for private gathering, and even a service area for small group in the kitchen- a VIP offer with the chef!. Our dishes expressed both extremes... my wife was happy to taste a dish she never had... A shell called Lamb is.. liked it. But dissapointed by the chicken Colombo de volaille Fermière.. but loved the famous black rice venere... I did taste it and true it was! I had the pied de porc a typical lyon dish....I liked it but the presentation could be more gastro.. The main dish the ""porcelet"" great dish wish a marvellous polenta!.. The waiters still needs to get use to high level service. Most of them are.. but still a few needs to work on that. We went after to the bar, and the service was very professional.. sort of old style service.. A real cocktail team leading. Like to see the idea of the little private herbal indoor garden Nice!",8

I showed up at the beginning of the shift and was told my wife would have a cupcake with a candle. It was not and I saw nothing coming (while I saw this cake pass for another table!) During the meal: Wine put on a dessert, no one came to serve us and we were forced to serve ourselves - Error on 2 entries, we waited 15 min before they were changed The pigeon was bleeding, we had to cook it. I had visited many times and everything had gone well so far. I am very disappointed by this evening that I would have liked as a beautiful family evening. Mr. Monge made me a commercial gesture on the invoice and must see with his manager to send me an invitation for a tasting menu for 2 people. I'm waiting for this invitation to come back and try the experiment at your institution and find out if it was a one-time mistake or if you really fell into mediocrity.
