4.0,Marc T,March 8 2020,47,"We had a very warm welcome. The view is marvellous. Amuse bouches were good, except one. The rest of the starters very good and the main course, salers beef with foie gras was exceptional. Le charriot des fromages was to die for. The sommelier had a very good knowledge of the wines and was very attentive. Unfortunately one of the waiters announced tartare of scallops when it had to be oysters and had to recuperate our plates when she was mistaken. Not worthy a Michelin star restaurant, but it didn’t spoil our evening. I missed the maitre d’hotel the whole evening. I hoped he was coaching his staff",12
4.0,Virg A,April 22 2024,169,"Lyonnais, we wanted to test the table and the setting for years without daring to take the plunge because the dated exterior of the Sofitel put me off. What a nice surprise inside! Obviously the view is crazy and the place is modern and warm. I recommend coming when the days are getting longer or at midday to take advantage of the daylight because surely linked to energy savings, the city is not very well lit in the evening from this point of view. The starter/2 course/dessert menu was excellent, you don't get lost in the flavors. The service was at the level of the evening. On the other hand, a disappointment on the wine list, which is much too expensive, a real shame not to offer several bottles below 45 euros. For the lunch menu at 38 euros I agree with a previous comment it is really regrettable.",12
4.0,Jean Claude H,January 3 2024,171,"First test of this restaurant whose cuisine was taken over by Chef Jeremy Ravier. The €38 menu served at lunchtime from Monday to Friday is recommended. The original and refreshing starter (frozen oysters), the cooking of the perfect lote and the dessert, well balanced in terms of flavors and sugar. The service is friendly and attentive without being obsequious and of course the view is exceptional. We will come back to try the menu at 70/82€ in the evening. One regret, the wine list should include a few bottles for less than €50 to accompany the €38 menu.",12
5.0,John G E,September 21 2023,5,"Visiting from the US, and found about the restaurant through a chance meeting with Lou. She helped secure a dinner reservation for us, and was our server. Lou was very knowledgeable about the menu and the background of the kitchen staff. She helped us in making a menu substitution due to a particular food allergy, which was greatly appreciated. Additionally, she assisted us in choosing a perfect wine pairing.  Abel was also attentive throughout the meal, and was extremely helpful and friendly. He made a great recommendation for our digestif which capped off a delightful evening. We had three courses plus dessert, all delicious and wonderfully presented. Excellent contrast in flavors on all plates. The duck was magnificent! The view of the evening city is spectacular, and the interior of the restaurant is quite comfortable and bright. We recommend Les 3 Domes unconditionally!",12
4.0,pilarin21,February 18 2024,46,"Everything was perfect except the service. Superb view, well installed. beautiful dishes and menus. All the dishes were beautiful and very good. The staff nice, but disorganized. We waited a long time to get the menu cards. We were the ones who asked for appetizers, which took a very long time to arrive. The first courses were about to be served, and we still didn't have the appetizers. Between the starters and main courses, a waiter brought us 2 coffees that we had never asked for. We had asked that dishes for young children be served as a priority. But that was not the case. Damage!!!!",12
3.0,Sigismond Bourdon,January 29 2024,127,"Three waiters took care of us. Two impeccable but a third very heavy, absolutely wanting to give us a glass of champagne for 25€ for the aperitif and red wine for the meal even though we had asked for white wine. In terms of plates, starters and main courses worthy of the lost Michelin star, but unfortunately the dessert drastically reduced the quality of the meal. As a ""surprise from the chef"", we were treated to a heavy and uninteresting millefeuille with hazelnut cream. What remains is the exceptional view. For that, no bad surprises to fear!",12
5.0,Lawrence H,September 14 2024,38,"We had the most wonderful evening at this restaurant. It is rare indeed that a restaurant combines service, food and a spectacular view. We had a very special dining experience. The staff was helpful, friendly and the timing of the meal service was perfect. We enjoyed a three course fixe price meal that was wonderfully prepared and elegantly presented, The wine that was suggested paired well with our food.",12
3.0,PierrotParis_France,April 28 2024,516,"Last visit in January 2020 very happy. Last night, quite disappointed. Good level of welcome and service in general. We will forget the fact of not removing the bread or the crumbs before offering the dessert menu. Excellent desserts both in appearance and taste. The rest... With an aperitif at €21 for a glass of Champagne, without the bottle being presented, a nice little 1cm² amuse bouche is a bit short. The rest of the dishes, good things like this veal fillet cooked to perfection, the accompaniments more questionable because you get lost. I'm still looking for the morels from the ""pressed potatoes"", as for the ""green asparagus"": asparagus cut into thirds! And the wine list, in my last passage, I wrote ""wines at reasonable prices"". Here, the hammer blow! in Burgundy in white you have to count on €150 as a starting price... Certainly you can have Domaine de la Romanée Conti for almost €10,000... which is the price. The service is generally professional, the desserts top, the view always remarkable but overall a disappointment! But the room was full...",12
2.0,Martini911,October 21 2022,55,"Really disappointing food. The worst meal we had over the tour of France. Their menu online said they did a salad lyonnaise, as one would expect in Lyon. When we arrived, it wasn’t on their menu and somehow they didn’t have any of the ingredients (no bacon or egg?). My partner was given a salad with uniform pre-sliced reconstituted chicken, as one might find in a cheap supermarket. The burrata and tomorrow starter was also very poor with cheap, flavourless burrata that was almost frozen cold and the tomatoes were limp. Clearly they had made the dish, wrapped it in cling film, and kept it in the refrigerator.  The view was nice and the dessert trolley looked ok but we didn’t try it as the other food was of such low quality.",12
4.0,Jean H,October 13 2023,915,"Nice but a disappointment. With the great views and the dining room this should have been great. All the other restaurants we went to in Lyon were better, and two wee much less expensive. Not great for gluten-free. Although most appetizers were GF, only one main was GF other than a vegetable plate. Big mark-ups on the wines. Annoyingly, they did not keep the bottle on the table, but did not make Sur they kept our glasses filled - worst of all worlds.",12
3.0,Laura,September 20 2023,30,"Very nice meal in this restaurant. Only the main course could have been a little warmer, but the rest of the food could not be faulted. The service, on the other hand, was really poor. We had opted for a bottle of wine, but it was barely served. We had to constantly wait for a waiter and signal to ask for another drink, which is really not relaxed. Unfortunately, we cannot call the staff really friendly and professional... at the end we were enjoying our coffee with 3 other tables, but in the meantime the restaurant was being closed very noisily for breakfast. Beyond conviviality…",12
2.0,Esteban Nicolas R,August 22 2024,1,"While in Lyon for the holidays, and we had heard too much about this restaurant. That's good. But we found nothing of quality in what we ate. The dishes are nothing special at all, I would say not even eatable. Award quality is not consistent at all. Moreover, we feel very well that the waiters have no pleasure at all to do what they do, no smile, we had the Impression of disturbing. And on top of that the intolerable heat with the clime that does not work!!! In short a very bad time, we would have been better at the Novotel. Too bad the whole family was looking forward to it. We're never coming back. Avoid!",12
4.0,Andrew G,March 17 2024,328,An edge if disappointment in the gastronomic capital of France. It was Friday night before the rugby and full turning rablesfrequently bit the numerous of waiters was simply inadequate.  Timothee and Nicolas did their best. The food was also disappointing a tough veal chop going home for the dog!. Could and should do. Better.,12
5.0,Isabel Bretones,August 4 2023,1,"We celebrated my husband's birthday on July 29th. We loved the finesse of Chef Jérémy Ravier's cuisine, the service was excellent, thanks to Nicolas and Lou, who took great care. Excellent welcome from Julien, very professional, smiling and friendly staff. With the view of Fourvière, the peninsula and La Croix-Rousse, what joy! We will gladly come back.",12
3.0,misster-wine,August 13 2023,72,"Overall mixed: the tables are close, the service experienced hiccups (forgetfulness, errors). The atmosphere is noisy, out of step with the restaurant's former status. The dishes are good but not unforgettable or remarkable. The parking lot is cramped and overpriced for the location",12
5.0,FRANCOIS A,September 13 2023,4,"The place is magical for such an occasion. We celebrated our 41st wedding anniversary here on September 4 and we were welcomed and accompanied by Antoine and Nicolas throughout the evening. Excellent menu, delicious bread, magnificent LP Champagne and the little surprise after the very delicate dessert. It was a Monday evening, and the only downside is that we will attack the one who serves as mayor of Lyon until 2026, and who does not deem it useful to light up the city's monuments from Sunday to Wednesday inclusive, whatever too bad, but the management of Trois Dômes has nothing to do with it!",12
5.0,Alecco007,September 22 2024,895,Beautiful panoramic view of Lyon. Impeccable service. The dishes are very well prepared. I personally liked the starter (compression of foie gras) and especially dessert. The latter is a coconut mousse with grapefruit confit.,12
1.0,matthieu c,September 12 2024,4,"Thinking of enjoying a high-end restaurant with a warm atmosphere?  Choose any establishment but not this one.  A literally icy atmosphere, 15 degrees in the room, because of a “climate problem” ... we had to go get some plaids in the car. The service was just as cold. Bordering on politeness on the young woman's side. As for the quality of the dishes.... If you like cellophane on your plates it’s perfect! The only heat from the restaurant? Hot stroke at the time of the check... 650€ to 7 for lunch at lunch... There are thousands of traffic jams in Lyon, so don't make our mistake, run away from this address!",12
5.0,alpsk59,February 19 2024,22,"Saturday February 17. What a great time! From reception until departure. Impeccable service, excellent dishes worthy of a gourmet restaurant, and the night view of Lyon (requested when booking and validated). We had a moment of pleasure, close to delight. The support from Lou, as well as from Nicolas the maître d’hôtel, was perfect. Present without being heavy, always with kindness, good humor and humor. The spontaneous offer to have a cheese for two, because we were hesitant, was very welcome. No false note. We will definitely come back.",12
5.0,Jbs,November 30 2023,22,"Excellent dinner, a mastery of the subject worthy of the greatest tables! A royal hare to make Antonin Carême proud, excellent sirloin, exceptional turbot! All orchestrated by Julien, exceptional chef, thank you for this welcome and this mastery",12
3.0,EdwardA2020,August 5 2021,17,We were looking forward to this one star Michelin restaurant. Amuses bouches not edible. Very sour. The food is not bad but so disappointing for such a restaurant. no tasting experience and highly overpriced for what you get. Service was good but snobbish atmosphere. the view is nice,12
2.0,Lydie P,July 1 2024,1,"As the air conditioning cannot be adjusted, the establishment chose very cold rather than very hot. As a result we ate in the fridge. Hoping to get this over with. We reported it. The staff are well aware of this but did not warn us to come well covered , nor did they offer us a plaid , let alone to shift out of the wind tunnels. In conclusion, before booking ask the question about the air conditioning situation and dress accordingly.",12
3.0,carole v,September 3 2023,3,"Delicious food, beautiful view of the city, but the staff was not always attentive and polite. We had to wait at least 10 minutes before we were allowed to sit down. We had to ask three times why we couldn't get the table of our choice: it wasn't reserved. Waiting a long time for the bill, I went to the cash register. The bill was incorrect twice and there was only a very thin excuse. That really doesn't fit with the allure that the restaurant wants to radiate.",12
3.0,FrenchFoodieAccro,November 12 2023,293,Popular restaurant in 2021. It was starred. What a collapse... - no more stars - lousy welcome. The room manager is clearly not at the level - brasserie atmosphere. Not great and very noisy. - high density of tables. Null. - and yet the dishes are good (except the desserts...). The chef's talent is wasted by everything else!!,12
5.0,Amèle L,February 16 2024,1,"Excellent welcome, impeccable service, the dishes were excellent with lots of flavors and well balanced. A superb view, I recommend with your eyes closed! A big thank you to Nicolas, Abel, Lou and Louis for their kindness, their smiles and their good humor!!",12
5.0,Jeff H,May 31 2024,143,Great dinner in this beautiful place in Lyon. We are very well received there and the cuisine is top notch. A breathtaking view and beautiful plates with refined dishes. Five stars for the team providing the service.,12
1.0,Allan M,October 6 2023,5,"My family came here for a nice dining experience- I wouldn't often choose a hotel restaurant but the view seemed unique enough to give it a try. First off, the hotel itself is a little dingy, and the seat we had was rough looking, with ripped leather- really not a great first impression. Then the staff had trouble accommodating our children's dietary/allergy needs. They claimed something got lost in translation but then admitted the chef refused to modify the dish appropriately- complete arrogance. The the maître-d got into an argument with me about what they consider steak to be - apparently they consider hamburger-style ground beef to be a steak filet, after we specifically inquired about it. Adult dishes were fine enough but my fish was terribly salty. Had to refill our own wine glasses because the staff was so slow/inattentive. No apology or accommodation about the dining issues. Such a bizarre dining experience overall and obviously the restaurant only survives because of the view. Biggest disappointment was missing a night at one of Lyon's many truly excellent restaurants with a chef/staff who know what they're doing.",12
5.0,Jilles S,July 7 2021,9,I have been here to eat for work together with a group of colleagues I must say that for work I am forced to travel many places both in Italy and abroad lately living in France I eat excellent food and this far exceeds all my previous expectations a about very friendly staff very nice place I Will come back,12
5.0,Rhumond Tonique,November 30 2019,39,"We reserved well in advance for a special dinner and requested a window table. Our request was honored and we enjoyed the 8 course ""Jardin Secret "" dinner. The food and service quality were what you expect from a Michelin one star, outstanding. I can't begin to describe each course, but the menu is available online. It included a selection of local and regional French food, presented in an intriguing and artistic manner. The views of the city and river were spectacular. The wine list was extensive and generally pricey, but did include a few affordable bottles. We settled for a cru beaujolais that went with a variety of fish and meat dishes.",12
5.0,Evgeny M,November 11 2019,133,Amazing place with excellent dishes and nice views! Although it is located in a quite old hotel... We were ordering 8-meals course (in reaility it was 12-meals with all these compliments). We have managed to finish it in 4 hours )) Everybody was amazed!,12
5.0,Mark G,November 4 2019,28,"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch in mid-October at Les Trois Dômes to celebrate our Sister's visit to Lyon. Their service was very warm and gracious.  The multi-course menu was carefully created by the chef, who was also happy to make adjustments based on an allergy to shellfish. Each course was delicious, and the amuse-bouches layered throughout the meal added surprise and interesting flavors. The wines recommended with each course were perfect complements for our dining. In addition the restaurant's grand views north over the heart of Lyon, and to the east across the Rhône toward the Alps are beautiful, a perfect setting for their fine cuisine. We recommend the cuisine and hospitality of the Les Trois Dômes team very highly.",12
2.0,Julia E,September 8 2019,11,"Great view but otherwise it was a Very disappointing experience. Overpriced, dry and tasteless food... especially for 1 Michelin star... Apart from a great cheese board.",12
5.0,Marion F,August 21 2019,46,We had a wonderful meal and the service was perfect. Got lots of complimentary courses so started to struggle towards the end of the meal. Great presentation especially the desserts. Terrific view over Lyon and the best way to end our time in Lyon.,12

5.0,Erik B,July 12 2019,72,"We went for lunch, reserving online with a set price. We got fantastic value for money, and enjoyed Michelin started service and food for what we’ve often paid for far less quality and service. The veal and truffle starter was amazing, and the salmon ceviche was even more amazing. They were really good at giving food that had multiple flavors, so each mouthful brought a new surprise. My lamb main was to die for. Desserts were really good too. Best value for money I’ve had in a long time!",12
5.0,indytravelgirl,July 7 2019,44,"Lyon has more Michelin starred restaurants than we had hours to enjoy and we enjoyed many! But this one, in my opinion, has the best choices for those who want to eat well, but still eat lightly or on a varied diet, such as vegan or dairy free. The view is delightful and we were so pleased to get a last minute table while staying at the hotel. The Maitre'd apologised for not being able to give us a table with a view, but we felt that all the tables had a beautiful view. We adored the Sommelier, Kevin, who had spent time in Amersham at one of our favourite places in the UK and we felt his recommendations were spot on. Overall, a brilliant experience.",12
5.0,newscreename2016,June 25 2019,150,"You expect the 'grande cuisine' when you choose a restaurant with a Michelin star. And this one delivers. Perfect view over the river. Attentive, but not obsequious service. Langoustine, pigeon and then the desserts. What desserts: melting chocolate, an apple that looks like an apple that's not an apple. Culinary artistry. We went for it and enjoyed it. €145 apiece including wine. So it's pricey, but good value for what it delivers.",12
4.0,Gourmand,June 10 2019,305,A beautiful venue overlooking the Soane River. I accidentally chose a Sea Bass tartar and did not enjoy it but it was still beautiful. My next dish was CANADIAN Lobster and it was superb. A real sommelier with grapes in his lapel helped choose our wine and it was as he said - a great vintage for a white burgundy. The cheese trolley followed - again wonderful with a choice of succulent jams.,12
5.0,156ashanti,March 30 2019,27,"Ok 1 star Michelin restaurant but the portions were much more than enough. No need to to get a kebab on the way home😂. No seriously this menu was something to remember, their ability to bring the perfect balance to a meal is incredible. Not cheap but if you want a gastronomic experience never to forget ( in a good way) take time go to Lyon and make a reservation!!!!!!!",12
5.0,YorkshireManinblack,January 20 2019,744,"I notice that a few people have given this restaurant poor or indifferent reviews, I can only speak of my own experience here and as I collected about 20 Michelin stars this calendar year I can honestly say this was one of the most enjoyable. The view certainly helps the sense of occasion, but the service is top notch, excellent, well matched wines and every course was well thought out. Presentation was good and flavour and texture exemplary. I hope to visit again",12
5.0,Birgül,January 14 2019,31,"We attended to the restaurant for lunch. The view is 180 degrees of Lyon very attractive. All the dishes we had were very delicious and elegantly designed and served.

4.0,Mark L,December 30 2018,8,"We booked this restaurant about one month before eating there on December 29 after reading reviews and seeing that they were recognized by Michelin. Perhaps having been jaded by a truly exceptional meal the week prior, I felt that the level of gastronomic art was very good but was slightly disappointing. The ambiance was pretty, and we had a spectacular evening view of Lyon, but the place seemed more like a busy hotel dining room (it was on the top floor of the Sofitel) rather than providing a sense of serenity and professionalism that marks a restaurant at the top of its game. The amuse bouche courses were rather ordinary, with the all too-frequent use of duck pate even though it appeared in several of the ordered dishes to follow. The appetizer dishes of scallops, quenelles, and lobster salad were quite good. My main course was a daily special of hare prepared with pate and truffles, and was indeed excellently, but the inflexible prix fixe menu formats required me to order my dinner a la carte, rather than allowing me to include this in one of the prix fixe menus with a supplemental charge. The desserts were well-executed, particularly the Valrhona chocolate trio. The cheese assortment was good, but ordinary.  Overall, this is a very good restaurant, but it did not achieve the level of culinary excellence that one would expect from the high standards of Lyon, the reviews, and the prices.",12
2.0,Megan S,December 2 2018,1,"To the team of Les Tois Domes,  I would like to extend to you my disappointment after my experience at your restaurant on Saturday December the 1st. I had a dinner reservation with my husband (Julien Murgatroyd) for our anniversary. We live in Leysin, Switzerland and drove to Lyon with high expectations of your restaurant. The menu that we both had (Les Jardins Secrets) was anything but. The amuse bouche was like a party sandwich that my grandmother would make. The Oyster scallop tartar tasted mostly of mayonnaise, the Quenelle was a highlight, however I had the exact same dish at a Bouchon for lunch earlier in the day and it was just as good (if not better) and fed 2 people for 11 Euros. Although the plating of the scallop was up to my expectations, the scallop itself was warm and chewy (I could do better at home.) The champagne granite was also a highlight...The beef was ok, but did not stand out aside from the fois gras ravioli.(Again, luke warm as if the plates were waiting to be served. Considering the amount of wait staff, the food runner should be on point. The cheese plate was ok, but seemed like a huge effort for the server cutting the cheese. Although we were disappointed the dessert was fine...thank you for the thought of the extra dessert for our anniversary. It was a nice gesture.   When we arrived we loved the beautiful atmosphere, the service from the wait staff and sommelier was very attentive. We noticed that there were a few tables free next to the windows and we asked to move, but were told that they were reserved based on time of booking. The reservation never came, a couple sitting next to us (arriving 1/2 hour later) asked to move and were relocated next to the window as we were eating our amuse bouche. Seemed a bit biased and selective..don't you think? This set up our pallet for the next 2 hours. This is not our first experience at Michelin star restaurants, we had high expectations based on reviews and research. We had reservations at Prairial but decided to dine with you. We regret this decision. This was our wedding anniversary and although we enjoyed our stay at La Cour Des Loges our dining experience was a great let down. Unfortunately we cannot recommend your establishment to any of our friends and business associates.",12
5.0,204IreneS,October 26 2018,33,"We ate here twice during a five day visit to Lyon. The food is excellent and artfully presented.

5.0,aender,September 25 2018,547,"Last year when we visited Lyon we had dinner here and had a fabulous experience. Our second time almost matched that first experience, but some of the dishes from a presentation perspective didn't match some we had the time before. As before service was on target and the overall three hour experience was a pleasure. The food was delicious and the way they were presented can be seen in the photos I took. Not sure why this isn't rated higher, but I love the place and our favorite course is the cheese cart they bring. This time I let the lady choose for me and she sliced off seven different ones; which all were amazing (why can't we get these in the states). Great time as always.",12
4.0,AndreVidalPinheiro,September 23 2018,132,"Went there for dinner on my birthday. Make no mistake, the food is great and deserving of its Michelin star. That being said, given the expectation of such a place and the price point for the meal, it wasn't the most memorable of its kind. The service was good, but still not up to scratch when compared to, for example, their UK counterparts (mind you, I'm not British). Several times had to continuously scan the room for a few minutes before could get the attention of one of the staff. We went for the wine pairing, and the wines were great - as you would expect from a top-notch french restaurant, but typically you get a bit of an explanation and details about the wine region, producer, etc. and there was none of it here. For the food, the amouse bouche were not memorable and sub-par in my opinion. You wouldn't expect to eat a nice enough but trivial niguiri in a french restaurant. We chose the ""jardin secret"" tasting menu, which was extensive and in the end we were in dire need of a long walk to burn it down. Some of it was memorable, others weren't. OF particular note and truly excellent was the cheese cart, which was definitely the best ""cheese course"" I've had. The problem was that for each inventive and surprising course there was one average (for the kind). All and all was a nice meal but not worthy of the 5-star of an outstanding place, given the restaurant category.",12
3.0,Elizabeth F,September 19 2018,53,"We wanted to eat a nice lunch today, so we decided to go here since it’s Michelin starred and also got good reviews here. We go to a lot of restaurants and also Michelin ones, so we are well aware that the lunch menu is simpler and usually not the same standard as the dinner, but here I’m sorry to say I felt I’m just wasting my time and money. I gave it 3 stars only because of the amuse-bouche and the dessert. We felt those are the only dishes that were appropriate for a high rated restaurant. Probably at dinner the dishes are better than we got at lunch. The first courses simply didn’t work: the potato salad with the fish was so simple in taste, and the egg with the leek simply didn’t mix and i just felt I’m eating a cooked egg with a cooked leek. Mixed reviews for the main courses: the fish was too salty and didn’t mix well with the sauce, but the pork was cooked very well, yet nothing special in flavor. Both had veggies on the side that were prepared nicely. The service was kind of rushed and the ingredients weren’t explained to us for the start and main courses (maybe because it was so simple?). One of the waiters also felt kind of rude, he was aggressive in his pouring the water, taking the dishes and cleaning the table. It’s hard to explain but it gave us a weird feeling.",12
5.0,wineloverColorado,September 16 2018,12,"Absolutely amazing food! The setting was beautiful, but the service and the food were just incredible. We actually had the cheapest menu, and every single bite of food was beyond what we expected. They brought us an appetizer we were not expecting: a fois gras Napoleon that was indescribable. OMG. Then I had two fish dishes and my husband had a fish and a lamb. Every bite made our eyes close with joy. The cheeses were generous and ripe, the deserts were inspired: altogether the perfect meal. Don’t miss it!",12

Such as you aspect if you eat more often in good french Restaurants. But what you find on the dishes is more than perfect food, for me it's art. Hard to describe. Whatch the pictures. This is worth any Euro you spend.",12
5.0,curlew,July 29 2018,398,We indulged in one of the set menus with the wine pairings. The service is what you would expect of such a restaurant attentive and friendly. The food itself was excellent and flavoursome which for me is the most important area. The wine pairings also complemented the food well and we're well chosen. Would really like to have awarded four and half stars.. Purely comparing with other Michelin star restaurants..thanks to the staff and the chef for the evening,12
5.0,Michael M,July 10 2018,26,"From the first taste to the last, each item was a offered a distinctive presentation and gustatory experience. The staff were attentive and pleasant, but not intrusive. We had the secret jardin selection with a few wine pairings that were excellent choices. There were eight courses to the dinner, and by the end we were barely able to finish the fine chocolate dessert—yet each serving was small and not overwhelming. I would highly recommend making this a stop in Lyon.",12

5.0,Jordaanwy,July 4 2018,174,I visited this restaurant situated on the rooftop of the Sofitel with a customer and the view over the city is magnificent. We went for the3 course lunch menu and this was very reasonably priced. The only point to improve from my point of view was the choice of champagne. I prefer when restaurants of this category choose a rather unknown house than the big famous brands.,12

This was not the first time, for the food and the service has always been good. However I detected a new flair to the menu and found the dishes more daring. It was very good. We took the lobster menu and every dish had some part of the lobster. A feast for the eyes and pallet.",12

Les Trois Dômes without a doubt has the most beautiful view of Lyon with a panorama from La Basilique Notre Dame de Fourvière to the domes of the recently renovated Hôtel-Dieu on to the Université Lumière Lyon 2; it is stunning at sunset and into the night. But the best part of an evening here is the innovative cuisine of chef Christian Lherm! We chose the Trois Domes menu opting for the three courses which also included several amuses-bouches. Each dish was beautifully presented, delicious and progressed well to the desert offering. The most unusual dish was an extra from the chef of a smoky chocolate ""cigar"" which arrived under a small glass dome! We also enjoyed a delicious breakfast here the next morning. Highly recommended!",12
5.0,1939Travelguy,April 8 2018,251,"We opted to stay at the Sofitel Hotel in Lyon to have dinner at the Trois Dômes restaurant and we were not disappointed. We selected the Trois Dômes menu and this review will not do justice to the visual delight, extraordinary textures and delicate tastes offered by each dish as well as the excellent service. The sommelier was helpful and recommended an excellent St-Joseph wine. Each dish was a visual delight. In addition, the diverse ingredients were in perfect harmony serving to offer exquisite tastes and delightful textures in the mouth. The first dish was a scallop carpaccio with celery petals combined with squid ink, truffle mousseline and a shard of Périgord cheese. This was followed by a filet of John Dory with shellfish and seaweed. The third dish was a saddle of lamb served with a small roasted fillet in confit skin and potatoes with cardamom. The cheese tray contained a wide variety of classic French and a selection of goat milk cheeses. There were two desserts followed by candies served with coffee. In all, it was a memorable meal with flawless service served in a setting that offered a bird’s eye view of the three domes in the city.",12

5.0,Lynge Te,January 21 2018,1580,"We had a menu with several courses. It will go to far to explain every dish, but see the photos and the menu called ""Jardin Secret"". However, in general it was so delicious and with a huge variation - fish, meat, vegetables, cheese and dessert. All arranged and made so the taste was in top and it was a true pleasure for the eye as well. Also we choosed the wine menu and the Sommelier served us 5 different wines - all a pleasure to drink with each dish they served. Service was perfect - the waiters, the sommelier and the restaurant chef all made efforts to make the evening great, On top the view over Rhone river and the eastern part of Lyon was fantastic - we had a table so we in fact could see also part of the western part of the city, including The Fourviere cathedral. Just perfect!",12
4.0,Victoria G,January 4 2018,430,"This place is beautiful. Located on the top floor of the Sofitel Lyon it has a nice decoration and beautiful view over the river. The food is amazing and you have the option of choosing wine pairing for smaller menus if you wish to. The sommalier was extremely attentive and made an excellent choice of wines for us. We took the menu with 3 dishes and dessert. We got 2 amuse-bouches: little selectionood aperitives and salmon on cauliflower pure. The dishes were: foie gras and chutney, scallops with mushrooms and white beans (delicious), beef filet with little vegetables and beef cheeks, cheese and pear pie. It was a great experience. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is because they do not give menus with the prices to women. I got a priceless menu and my husband got one with. I believe that is very tacky and out of date practice! I totally recommend coming here if you are in Lyon!",12
5.0,Leonard,December 26 2017,120,We had a nice evening just the two of us. The view over Lyon is great and the service is very attentive. We enjoyed a 3 course dinner which has been a real dream to eat. Also the cheese choice at the end is just amazing. Just like we love it.,12
5.0,Challenger007,December 9 2017,958,"After a very long exhausting wet day, we arrived at Les Trois Domes for Dinner. It was not the ideal start for a special meal, but as soon as we were seated and welcomed by the kind young Woman who would take care of us all evening, things began to unfold marvelously. The view is stunning and were that all-it suffices to say it's astounding. The Dining Room is intimate yet tables are spaced for privacy and situated to take advantage of the view. We were seated near the glass overlooking the City. We chose the Lobster Menu which  divides the courses into a focus on the ""parts"" presented in unique ways (Tail, Elbow, Body, and Claw). Dinner began with two gifts from the Chef, a cute rectangular tray of Canapés fashioned to resemble confections and a Cauliflower Purée topped with cured salmon, caviar and a ""sea fan"" tuile made of squid ink... Now the Chef had our full attention. We were glad we pulled ourselves out of our wet sluggish funk before the Parade of Lobster. Probably the most creative series of Lobster based dishes we've ever seen or eaten. Too detailed to explain and not worth the spoiler alert. The wine pairings were perfect too. Dinner was followed by Pre-Dessert, Dessert, and Post-Desserts. Absolutely marvelous!!!",12
5.0,mll,October 20 2017,44,"We went for lunch at Les Trois Domes, a one star Michelin restaurant. The food, service, and ambiance was perfect. The views of the city and the Rhône River from the 8th floor of the Sofitel are stunning, so ask for a window table if possible. We had the pre fixe menu, which was beautifully presented and delicious.Our entree was raw fish over an avocado puree and our main was pheasant wrapped in spinach with rillettes on the side. There was a pre dessert platter of 4 small bites ranging from apricot, coconut, chocolate before the dessert.  This restaurant is a dining experience. Lunch is more reasonably priced than dinner.",12
4.0,Doug B,October 20 2017,58,"The views from this 8th floor restaurant are almost as good as the plating of the food. This was the prettiest food I have ever eaten. Each plate is a work of art that must have been assembled using tweezers.  The langoustines in rice paper wrappers with finely diced veg were good, but slightly flat, as was the duck. Everything just seemed to need a bit more seasoning and flavour. But overall, a pleasant room and meal for lunch at a reasonable price.",12
5.0,NZ T,October 18 2017,18,"Stopped here as part of Uniworld river cruise. Chose to have dinner in town. Very short walk across the river to the Sofitel. Excellent restaurant and great service. Go the chefs menu for sure, and have the wine match which is very good and very reasonably priced at 55euro. Don’t let the Michelin 1 Star put you off- it is better than a number of 2stars we’ve been to- must be they are striving hard! View was beautiful as the sun set and the lights came on.",12

4.0,Alysli,October 4 2017,124,"Perhaps we were somewhat jaded by our earlier experiences with the hotel. The Trois Domes has spectacular views and the food is very high quality, although I didn't find it especially inspired. The bar is too small and too crowded for a pleasant aperitif, and the prices are high.",12
5.0,Phyllis P,September 14 2017,56,The meal lasted two an a half hours. There were many courses and exquisite presentation. The meal was one that appealed to all my senses and really was a delight! The service was attentive. The main course dishes were served under a dome and removed upon presentation. I would go to Lyon just to eat there again!,12
2.0,maxr56,August 20 2017,85,"The Sofitel is a rather anodyne 5 star hotel but its claim to fame is its restaurant on the top floor, I arrived straight from the train station, a pleasant welcome in a dingy corridor next to the night club, they took my bags and I was seated at a nice table overlooking the river vista, friendly staff, I chose a la carte, nibbles weren't standout but just ok, to start a classic Lyonnaise dish, quenelles de brochet with a crayfish sauce, wow this dish was as as good as it gets perfect pike ""dumplings"" that had superb texture, flavour, light yet substance with a masterful crayfish sauce, fresh crayfish and a little sautéed spinach to balance simply put a 3 star dish. One of Lyon's best butchers is Maurice Trolliet, a MOF and he supplied the Salers beef fillet for the main course, I always wonder when chefs create dishes that in my opinion fall short not just in terms of cooking technique but conceptually as well, I order my beef rare and reiterate this to the maitre d', what arrives leaves me speechless a brochette/skewer of beef and foie gras the beef over cooked and almost damp/wet in texture, been cooked in a cool pan ?, the foie gras again no heat in the pan so all wobbly no texture the three stuffed vegetables had the same tasteless mushy ratatouille in each..? I sent this back after eating a tiny piece, the waiter offered me another or something other I declined in retrospect I should have had a second quenelle...but frankly my appetite had gone, they insisted on serving me a small portion of mediocre cheese, then a rather poor pre-dessert and to finish a poorly made bitter tasting espresso with a cheap almost disposable foil spoon this rounded the lunch off, despite not easting my main course I was charged for it on the basis of 2 tiny pieces of cheese offered? On leaving the receptionist had disappeared, no one in the restaurant knew where my luggage was, a fitting finish to what was a very disappointing lunch, despite the wonderful quenelles not sure I would return, there are much much better restaurants in Lyon at this price Mere Brazier for one and far better value.",12

Service level is 4.5/5 (English not good for all the waiters). Location is 4/5 (not super central, ask for a window seat ... for enjoying a beautiful view over Lyon). Presentation of the food is 4.5/5 , but food is not more than a 4/5. Overall price/quality ratio is not adequate (3/5); is one of those places where you come once, and you go back home without the emotions of a great food experience to remember forever.",12

Reservations are a must - we had the first 7:30 PM reservation, but when we left at 10:15 PM the restaurant was full. We ordered from the Fix Prix menu, and each course (7-9 depending on how you count courses) came every few minutes after completing the previous one. The food was OUTSTANDING, well deserving the one star rating. It is hard to explain what each course was, but all had a unique presentation. I highly recommend this restaurant if you have the time (and budget - €250 for two)",12

2.0,Sarah C,November 8 2016,16,"I don't like to write a bad review but feel I have to do so in this case. Our dinner here 2 weeks ago was a serious disappointment and a very sad introduction to our weekend in Lyon (which turned out to be very enjoyable). There's nothing wrong with the restaurant, the lovely view or the very attractive presentation of the food. However, service was lacking and the food was dreadful. The Pike Quennelles, rather than being light and moussy, were solid rubbery flavourless lumps in an over-rich Crayfish sauce. The Cote Cochon had absolutely no flavour whatsoever - even when I shut my eyes to concentrate, I could not tell what the meat was supposed to be. My husband's 'Flowing Egg' was OK but again there was no flavour in the accompanying mushrooms and sauces. He enjoyed the meat of his Royal Hare dish, which was beautifully presented, but again the accompaniments including the Spaetzle in a baby pumpkin, sadly had no flavour. Personally, we use the phrase 'Flavour Extraction' to describe meals like this. We enjoyed a lovely bottle of Cote-Rotie Rostaing but the wine waiter kept it on a side table - when our main courses were served our wine glasses were empty. We had to waste time attracting the attention of the head waiter, who then had to find the wine waiter, before we could have our glasses refilled. Finally, when we left after paying a bill of Euros 398 (including the wine at Euros 130), no-one saw us out, said goodbye or went to get our coats. We had to stand by the host station until another waiter came past. We eat at many excellent restaurants including our local Michelin 1* and we know what standards of food and service to expect and at what price. Unfortunately this restaurant fell well below our expectations. Thankfully, we went on to enjoy several delicious meals elsewhere in Lyon.",12
2.0,amirrachmaninov,October 25 2016,96,We were recommended by friends to eat there. The view is superb the service is good (but not more than that) but the food was disappointing. We ordered a 3 curses menu one of them was Foie gras. As we asked to change another curse we did not ask to change this one but we were badly surprised that one of the appetizers consisted Foie gras as well and the curse with the foie gras included with it ginger that made it all un tasty and no one really cared or asked why. The deserts were a great disappointment as well! too complicated over done and partly even biter and salty. We paid too much for very little good food (mainly the Bress chicken which was really very good. there are so many good and delicious restaurants in Lyon this one is unfortunately not one of them!!,12

The food was generally of a good standard although the cereal I had to start was very stale and inedible. We had expected better given the reputation of the restaurant for dinner. We did not try dinner as they seemed unable to offer any vegetarian options.

We selected the ""flowing egg"" appetizer (with frog legs), the pigeon and the chicken main courses. There was lots of chanterelle and asparagus used in the dishes - everything very tasty, flavorful and artfully presented. We were treated with amazing amuse buche (savory carrot macaron with cumin is truly unforgettable). Chocolate and mint soufflé was our dessert - if you like mint flavor, it won't disappoint. Also we were treated with several complimentary desserts - beautiful and tasty. We had Clarendelle Bordeaux Blanc 2013 with the meal - and enjoyed every drop of it.

I was with a group of friends at the time, and we all agreed afterward that this was the most memorable dining experience of our trip to France. It was truly an extraordinary dinner. Service was impeccable, as you would expect for a restaurant like this. Each course was innovative, delicious, and beautifully presented. The two dishes that were standouts for me were the' Un oeuf Colant' and the 'Tourte De Langoustine' -- both were divine. The cheese course was utterly amazing as well. We are still talking about the deserts -- my favorite was the spectacular' Le Cigar Fumant'. The wines recommended by our sommelier were also quite good and paired nicely with the food. We later met the chef who discussed each course and talked about what inspired him to create each of the dishes we had. When we left at around 11:30, we were amazed that we had spent over hours eating, enjoying the conservation, and, of course, the great wine.

This restaurant is on top of the Sofitel and is glass, so the views stretch in every direction and are magical. We had the degustation, as did most dinners and it was exquisite, presentation was impeccable and the flavour combinations guaranteed to excite even the most disconcerting dinner.

The amuse bouche were very good.  I had the lamb chops. Perfectly medium - pink in the middle. The red wine reduction sauce and the sides were so good I was tempted to lick the plate clean. My wife had a fish dish and it was equally well done. Our souffle were perfect - not too big - came with strawberries and sorbet on the side. Wow.

2.0,James T,April 22 2015,16,"For those of you who only read a couple of lines here is the summary. Fairly competent food for an extortionate price, set within a pleasant 8th floor setting with wonderful views and very comfortable chairs.  So great room, wonderful views especially at night, and very comfy chairs make for a great ambiance. Ok so first we where left waiting for a menu for about 10 minutes, understand too that we arrived at 9pm only 30 minutes before kitchen closed, you would have thought they would be a little faster. Anyway we asked for menu and eventually got it, so result but not a great one. The menus arrived, and to our amusement the two men where given menus with prices and the two women given menus without prices. Frankly you'd think there is some European legislation against sex discrimination that would prevent such behaviour, however we all know the French would ignore it anyway. So take your pick be offended or amused,we chose amusement. Next the amuse bouche arrived, a curry flavoured piece of tuna, some lightly flavoured mozzarella in a plastic wrapper, and a rather strange tomato thing. None of which where good. We asked if we could eat the plastic wrapper but they did not understand English well enough to answer the question but we discovered the answer was no. It was clear this would not be a Heston style culinary adventure. At this point we had seen the prices and tasted the food and seriously considered leaving, however my mother eyes has lit up seeing foie gras starter, her all time favourite dish plus we where tired after travelling, checked trip advisor reviews and decided to stay.  I'll skip on a but at this point, and say only my mother on our table ordered a starter as I watching my waistline (cough) and decided to skip a starter in favour of a desert. I will add the foie gras starter my mother had was the highlight of the meal and simply sublime, my mother is a connoisseur of this dish and you should trust her judgement.  So on to the mains, (the second amuse bouche was better than first but this was not a great feat) The main dishes where tiny, I ordered the lamb which cost over €60 and consisted of 5 coin sized pieces of meat with barely enough sauce to cover half of them, another single coin sized price of veg, 1 clove of garlic and a small ramekin of undercooked lentils. For what it was the flavour was fine, meat unseasoned but sauce pleasant, however far from exceptional and certainly not wort the €10 euros each very small mouthful cost. Other mains where similar. For Desert I had the chocolate soufflé , but in reality was mostly a flourless chocolate cake, disappointing in a Michelin starred French restaurant they don't know the difference. Other deserts around the table where similar, although my mother thought her pineapple desert was good. Anyway I think you should get the idea. For 4 adults with 1 bottle of €70 wine the bill came to €450. We had 1 starter, 4 mains, and 3 deserts. You can do the maths, but this is damn expensive anywhere, for that price I could eat at the best restaurants in London, New York, Dubai or anywhere, and have an exceptional meal however the simple truth is this meal did not come close to world class standard, yet they request a world class price.  My advice is to best avoid. We also stayed in the hotel, but that's a separate review, but quickly better value than restaurant , breakfast was very good. Rooms a little dated however.",12

Started with a glass of house champagne. Took the lighter evening menu and was delighted. Excellent food, portion sizes were perfect, service was excellent and the wine waiter gave some good input into our choice of wine. Sadly we did not have the time to go to the bar on the other corner of the same floor for after dinner drinks but will definitely go there again for a cocktail - the view alone is worth it!!",12
4.0,Flugwiesel,April 7 2014,125,"I enjoyed the views of the Rhone river and Lyon. Even more pleasing was Lherm's cooking. All classical french grand cuisine, splendidly presented at a price that correlates to the house (Sofitel 5*hotel) and the produce used and the quality delivered. The service was courteous, discreet and effective. The fish dishes were lovely, the beech smoked brie de meaux is worth a try. However the desserts should be given a slight work over to leave more of a lasting impression on the dinner. If dining in the evening, bring at minimum two hours of your time with you. Best deal to be had at lunch.",12
1.0,koklaskuriakos,November 15 2013,1,"We visited Les Trois Domes restaurant this week. The food was worse than average. As about the dessert it was really bad. We had also visited the restaurant in 2010 and the food was amazing. But now the situation was strange. Nobody from the people who was working there asked us our opinion about the food so we did not had any opportunity to express our disapointment. Ιt was really expensive compering the price with the quality of our meal. What is more, we found the raw materials that were used poor and the dished cooked without any inspiration. For example they served ice-cream's cornet full of beans.Even the bread was cold. I really believe that we have to reconsider if this restaurant worths a Michellin star.",12
5.0,BWAdam,September 9 2013,11,"We booked this as part of a treat to stay at the Sofitel and we were not disappointed by either the food or service - flawless in both regards and definitely worthy of the Michelin star. We had the matching wines and both waiter and sommelier were very happy to tell us about the food and wine choices in english, and to answer extra questions on them. We asked for a nice table for our anniversary and were given a table near the panoramic viewing window with a lovely view over the east of the city and river Rhone- very romantic and a perfect evening",12
5.0,NJChisoxFan,August 9 2013,198,"My wife and I took a side trip to Lyon from Paris to see the old town and eat in this Michelin-starred restaurant. Les Trois Domes was amazing. It was packed on a Wed. night, and as far as we could tell, all the other patrons were French (a good sign). The decor and architecture were not to our taste but the setting atop the Sofitel Hotel was breathtaking, especially on a summer night when it's fully light outside at the beginning of the meal and and dark at the end. In between you see the darkness roll in over the city, and it's quite dramatic.   But that's just the setting. The menu has three choices: a la carte, a lower-level set meal that did not look very appealing to us, and a higher level set meal (Secret Jardin) that we wisely selected. It cost 125 Euros pp and was well worth it, because if you are going to do this, do it right. This was a beautiful meal, nicely served. The pan-fried duck foie gras, the pike-and-spinach quenelle, the selection of cheeses, and the dark chocolate souffle stood out. The service was not only paced right but also exceptionally friendly and pleasant, which is not generally the case at such places. (After more than three hours, we chatted casually, in English, with members of the staff for 15 minutes after the dinner.) I don't eat beef, but there was no problem substituting for my main. Since we are serious foodies but not serious wine drinkers, we asked the sommelier to recommend a glass of wine that would go well with the whole meal. He was not in the least put off by this request, gave it serious thought, and finally came up with a particular white wine that was really special and absolutely perfect for our purposes. There are various extra courses, and you just sit back and enjoy it. Best of all, after about ten courses of superb food, we left the restaurant feeling completely content, without that awful stuffed feeling that is so common after a big meal. That's owing to a combination of the food itself and the pacing (if this is what some other reviewers mean by slow service, I'm sorry that they could not appreciate it.) The final bill including two glasses of wine, mineral water, taxes and service was 285 Euros for an experience that we will always cherish. We have eaten at 3-star Michelin restaurants, and as a total experience including food we enjoyed this more.",12

The head waiter was very rude and service was in general slow and waiters interrupted our conversation on a couple of occasions, generally lacking those little touches you would expect from a good restaurant. The after eight sweet was one of the best I have had but it was a jewel in an otherwise very dull crown. Worth going for the views so go early evening to see the sun setting and the lights of Lyon coming on - don't bother dressing up, jeans were the generally the accepted dress code.",12
2.0,Stijn O,March 30 2013,16,"I've stayed at the Sofitel a few times and eaten a Les Trois Dômes twice and both times I have been underwhelemed by the quality and taste of their menu dishes completely in contrast with their amuse-bouche which are great. This time I had dinner and took the Lobster Tart which looked amazing, smelled great but at the moment of tasting it was clear to me that A) the potato slices where not all cooked well (some where chewy, some where crunchy and some where cooked right) which did not make it a pleasant experience to eat and B) It did not seem like the lobster was the freshest it could be as the flavour was just not there... The only thing on the menu that I highly recommend is stuffing yourself with the cheese dessert. You might be given 3 slices of stingy bread but don't be afraid to ask for more! Overall I'd rank it on the bottom third of Michelin starred restaurants I've gone to.",12
2.0,pslensuisse,November 7 2012,9,"We booked through the hotel a lunch for four one busy Saturday at 12:30 pm. By the time we left the restaurant it was close to 4 pm. This wasn’t because we dallied on our parts, this was start to finish what it took to be served from a three-course set menu on a Saturday. We wouldn’t have minded the time it took, but for the demeanour of the staff who waited on us – when they remembered to do so. While a Michelin star isn’t expected to be a reflection of service standards, it’s seldom unacceptable, which was the case from the outset here. After we were seated we waited about 20 minutes before we could catch anyone’s eye to ask for a menu. We were studiously ignored before that, a real trick given that we were seated somewhat closer to the kitchen. The request was finally acknowledged, and then we had another wait before four dishes mysteriously appeared. We figured that this was the amuse bouche and they’d give us the menus later - well and good if they had a system they obviously wanted to follow, but perhaps someone should have bothered to say so, which is the custom at other Michelin restaurants.  When someone was finally ready to take our order, there was confusion over one of the set menus they offered. The way the menu was designed appeared to suggest a choice between two starters, and then a main, followed by cheese and a choice of desserts. The confusion was compounded by the fact that except for dessert, the dishes were all listed without an “either this, or that” choice. It turned out that there was only one starter, which was not at all obvious based on the layout of the page. We also thought initially the 2 course was a choice of starter and main, or main and dessert, but were told the only options were to take a starter and main, or to take all three. The waiter who took our order grew impatient, couldn’t explain this properly, and repeatedly suggested we take the a la carte. I stuck to the 96 euro set menu and took all three courses. The cheese never arrived. Although we’d given up asking about the menu by that time. Towards the end of the meal, a waiter just starting to pour tea for our guest, ran out of tea and returned to the kitchen. The tea when our friend touched it, was cold – they had obviously brought someone else’s used pot out by mistake. We expected a freshly-brewed pot and cup when the waiter returned (this was supposed to be fine dining after all, but our hopes were rapidly dimming), but he merely topped up the same cup, and when we stopped him and pointed out that we were aware there was old tea inside, he pulled a face. In summary, we’re nonplussed about the 1 Michelin star. While the food and presentation were decent, they weren’t so good that we could ignore the service, which was truly inexcusable, and surprising, given the general excellence in all areas we’ve found at other restaurants in the city. Our experience was closer to those reflected in the October reviews on the viaMichelin site itself. We’ve always recommended Lyon to friends for its dining experiences, so this will be the first time it’s a definite “no”.",12
5.0,Gtchaz,September 8 2012,29,"Lyon has a much deserved reputation as the culinary capital of France, as it was our first visit to the city we were searching for a memorable 'michelin star' gastronomique experience - and we hoped Les Trois Domes would fit the bill. In every way it met and exceeded our hopes and expectations !! We were lucky enough to secure a reservation at short notice (probably only because it was a tuesday night) - but were astonished when the friendly maitre 'd showed us to our table in prime position right by the windows with a sweeping panoramic view of Lyon from the top floor of the Sofitel. The view of the city is breath-taking and the restaurant itself is elegant but cosy. The staff were incredibly welcoming and un-stuffy and immediately we felt at ease. We were encouraged to indulge in a pre-dinner glass of Tattinger champagne , which served to heighten the wonderful sense of 'occasion' ! The menu is exactly what you would expect from a michelin-star kitchen and includes some wonderful twists on classic Lyonnaise dishes. Before our starters arrived we were treated to a creme-brulee of foie gras , compliments of the chef - which was just superb ! My starter of warm foie gras with apple tatin was equally excellent (but I was over-loaded on foie gras at this point !) , my girlfriend's starter of shredded crab meat with avocado parfait and lemongrass jelly was a work of art that was as light and delicious as it was beautiful ! I had chef Christian LHerm's signature dish - Lobster tart as a main .... and again it was a work of art - hearty and filling but with beautifully balanced flavours of lobster, spinach and fennel. The star of the show was the Kadaif Scampi with zucchini flower stuffed with seasonal vegetables ordered by my girlfriend. Almost too beautiful to eat - this dish was possibly the greatest plate of food i have ever tasted !! Already full to bursting - while we waited for our desert order (the pace of service is perfect in my opinion) we were again treated to a complimentary dish from the chef .... a pre-desert of miniature chocolate fondant dressed in a vanilla foam - delicious. When our shared desert of Intense Guanaja Chocolate Souffle arrived - we really were completely full ..... but one taste of this incredible desert .....and we both just HAD to keep eating till the plate was clean !!!! Les Trois Domes gave us exactly what we hoped - a culinary tour de force ! It is a beautiful setting with a magnificent view , the staff are precise, knowledgable, charming and friendly. The wine list is comprehensive with well matched wines suggested for every dish. All in all we had the most memorable and wonderful evening of our holiday ....perhaps of any holiday ! There are many michelin-star restaurants to choose from in Lyon (some with 2 and 3 stars) - but for simply superb food at a reasonable price (300euro for 3 courses , champagne and a glass of wine each) and an amazing view of the city ...... you will find it hard to beat Les Trois Domes !!",12
4.0,CWB,July 29 2012,17,Couldn't fault the food or wine - the beef in particular was melt in your mouth delicious. The two separate platters of deserts on top of the cheese was a little bit of an overkill. It was my wife's birthday and they even came good on bringing out a chocolate birthday cake that I had asked them to see if they could arrange when we checked into the hotel. I got to take off one point though because this place certainly isn't cheap - our meal for 4 people was more than twice as expensive as our next most expensive meal during our 16 days on holiday - although I'd probably go back.,12

Although we weren't seated near the window, the views anywhere in the restaurant are excellent. Shortly after being seated we were brought amuse-bouche, which were quite good and full of many wonderfuly complimentary flavors. We decided to order from the less expensive of the two prix fixe menus, the Menu Presqu’Ile, which was 82€. I started with the Foie Gras de Canard Rôti which came with a Sechuan pepper sauce, kumquat, and broad beans. I chose the suggested glass of wine as well. For my main course I ordered the French Lamb Loin Chop, with Espelette Chili Pepper and Basil, Artichoke Barigoule, Small Red Pepper again occompanied by the suggest glass of wine. Everything was wonderful! I think the most interesting and overwhelming part of the evening was the selection on the large dual cheese carts that were carted out after the main course. When the server asked what I would like, I simply asked for her suggestion. She arranged three cheese whose names I didn't understand along with some dried fruit and nuts in a very specific order on my plate and pointed out what was to be consumed first, second, etc. It was fabulous. Finally, I completed the meal with the “Home Made” Ice Creams and Sorbets, which included Caramel Ice Cream, Coconut Ice Cream, Apple, Orange, Blood Orange, and Lime-Tequila contrasted with a cup of espresso. All in all it was an excellent meal! I would highly recommend it for couples, friends, business. Probably not the place to bring the average child, but I have one who would love it. Bon appetite!",12
