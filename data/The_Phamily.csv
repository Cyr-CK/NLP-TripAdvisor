5.0,amitabh k,December 2 2021,53,"Our delectable lunch at Chez Phamily Vietnamese on route de Boeuf needs a mention for superb tasting pho and Tom kha Kai soups, fresh tasting Bok Choy and gambas citronnelle . Our hostess was ably assisted by her family chef and our repas was served piping hot. The presentation and taste were really good and fresh ingredients in each of the dishes made the lunch very flavourful.Price wise I would say each starter was 9 euros and main range between 9-18 Euro . Will recommend for those not on a big budget .",332
4.0,bengals4,November 21 2021,595,Reeling from foie and friends and aching for capsaicin we wandered into Phamily in Vieux Lyon. Charming area and charming resto. The offerings hitting the bullseye. Do ask for extra Thai chilies however as the tolerance for capsaicin is next to zero in France so even “spicy” dishes are rather tame to the American palate.,332
5.0,florine v,March 5 2024,33,"Excellent Thai/Vietnamese cuisine. I recommend the raw beef salad. The Chef takes care to offer the chili on the side so that the dishes suit everyone's tastes. The restaurant is very small, I advise you to make a reservation. The service is very friendly. Very reasonable prices",332
3.0,TracCao,May 26 2022,140,"If you come from the US / Australia / Canada or Vietnam itself and expecting top notch authentic Vietnamese food, you will be disappointed. However, if you want a break from Lyonnais food then I would recommend it.  The restaurant is run by a Vietnamese family who has been in Lyon in 92. The son runs the front of house with dad cooking in the kitchen. Overall, it does a good take on Vietnamese food by Lyon standard but it is not particularly exciting. The menu is limited and has a blend of Thai and Vietnamese but it is Vietnamese first and foremost. The service was lovely and I would recommend it for this alone. Note though, it can get quite smoky inside and for those who are sensitive to these things, sit at the front if you can. I wish them well.",332
5.0,Philippe et Christine,October 16 2023,149,"Second visit to this restaurant on the very famous rue du Boeuf. And this time again we were won over. Very friendly welcome and service; we are not in the polite, but really in the exchange. Dishes always impeccable, everything is fresh, you can feel it. Light and generous cuisine. And thank you for the nice gesture :-). Very reasonable prices, including for the wines (including a Saumur Champigny 2018). A very good time and a place well noted in our address book.",332
5.0,worldcurious,July 26 2024,114,"I have had Bun Cha in many restaurants, but this was the absolute best with the freshest ingredients, beautifully served. Each of us loved the dish we chose. It is a lovely little spot, with fantastic service. Honestly, we’ve been in France for a week and this was, hands down, our favorite restaurant!",332
5.0,Marea L,October 11 2023,5,We were staying in Vieux Lyon and our daughter in law wanted Vietnamese food for her birthday. What a surprise to find such a great restaurant around 50 metres from our Airbnb. There were 7 of us and we ordered a number of different dishes and every one of them was exceptional. My spring rolls were probably the best I have ever had. The service was also very good.,332
5.0,Robert C,June 27 2024,240,"We visited here as a couple. Amazing flavours and service second to none. Attentive service and the food was the best we have had in France (sorry!) in 2 weeks. I’m not sure if you can book but we just walked up. We ordered the spring rolls to start with and they were melt in the mouth. We then ordered the sticky rice with onions, rice with Chinese sausage and beef with onions plus the prawn dish. All cooked to perfection. For dessert we ordered both the hot and cold mochi. Omg!! Was brilliant too! You will not be dissatisfied or disappointed here the quality and flavours were fantastic.  I’m sure if we had found this restaurant - few days ago this would now be our only place to dine! Amazing 10/10 A*.",332
5.0,Regula F,September 14 2024,1,"Very spontaneously we ate here. It was a great, quiet atmosphere. Although we did not reserve there was a table for us on a Saturday night. The service staff was very friendly and welcoming. The food came quickly and we tasted wonderful. Thank you very much we will come back and recommend you",332
5.0,Ty W,June 25 2023,7,Tuan was our waiter and did an excellent job helping us order incredible food that certainly hit the spot. It’s a great choice for Vietnamese food in Lyon!,332
5.0,Elaine N,November 5 2022,95,Everything was so good. We actually went back a second time to try some different items from the menu.,332
5.0,foodiept,June 12 2019,453,"We were in Vieux Lyon long enough to try several of the bouchons with their traditional Lyonnais food, but we also craved something different. So we tried this little Vietnamese place in a quaint little street - and enjoyed it so much we went back a few nights later! The pork spring rolls were so fresh and very tasty, served with heaps of lettuce. The chicken with coconut etc was incredibly tender and tasty and the serving was huge. I don't think I have seen such generosity of protein in any Asian meal in Australia. The chicken salad was delicious, and the banana fritters very good. On our return the spicy calamari was enjoyable despite the calamari being a bit chewy. The chicken with cashews was delicious - again, so much chicken we could barely get through it. We are used to playing ""find the cashew"" but in this case the dish was loaded with them. So much chicken and so many cashews! Unheard of. There were some vegetables too, but they were hiding under the mountains of chicken and cashews. The apple fritters were nice but not as good as the banana ones we previously had. The prices are reasonable for a restaurant in Vieux Lyon, and service is pleasant and timely. We are so glad we found this little gem.",332
5.0,foodjunkie15,October 12 2018,19,"After constantly eating rich food, we were craving for something light & fresh. I seldom venture into new Vietnamese restaurants as my biggest fear is will it stand up to my standard being of Vietnamese heritage. Are we glad we did!!! This place ticked all the boxes!!! I am still thinking of their spring rolls, served with fresh lettuce. The clean taste from the salad, accompanied by the ever-so crispy spring roll and the well balance nouc mam. We continued with one of their speciality - Beef Pho! This will be a good test! A feature of a good pho is a clear and well balanced broth that does not require any addition and that they delivered!!! Ahhhhhhh We finished with their banana fritters and that was one of the best banana fritters I’ve eaten!!! It takes me back to when I was a little girl in Vietnam, waiting for the banana fritter lady to walk my street. As we enjoyed our 3 course there, what was very evident is this place is a local favourite! If you ever get the chance to spoil your taste buds here, go out of your way to strike up a conversation with the lovely couple. We sure did and was welcomed into their life. I hope our paths will cross in Australia one day :)",332
4.0,O7950YPjoans,September 30 2018,162,"We dropped in by accident because of rain. It's a very small place and tables are very close together. One person is the waitress, server, and cashier but she is quite efficient. We ordered the beef pho and cashew chicken. The pho is a good sized bowl with plenty of beef and noodles. The cashew chicken had a unique taste which we believe may be honey on the chicken. It was very good in any case. The food comes quickly once the order is taken.",332
5.0,Priya H,September 3 2018,13,"This place was a surprise. We went in for lunch wanting something that was not French cuisine! Don't get me wrong, the French food we have been having has been amazing but I was missing soy sauce and ginger flavours. This little restaurant must have had someone call in sick because the guy running the place was SOLO!! He was the host, the waiter and the chef. The place as moderately full and yet, he did a great job all by himself. The food, let's talk about the food - we ordered the duck satay, fish with ginger, pork dumpling and Cantonese fried rice. Each of those dishes were made with such attention and packed with flavour. I highly recommend visiting this little restaurant and enjoying a flavourful meal at an affordable price.",332
5.0,Cheryl K,October 9 2017,46,"If you are looking for something other than the French menu of the day come here. The food is delicious, authentic Asian, and reasonably priced compared to other restaurants in the area. We ate here twice since we enjoyed it so much. We ordered Tom yum soup, beef pho, cashew chicken and Vietnamese chicken salad. All were very good. The service is fast and polite.",332
5.0,Cynhoff,September 18 2017,660,"I was a bit wary of going to a Vietnamese restaurant in France, but was very pleasantly surprised! My chicken with cashews was really, really good! I highly recommend it!",332
3.0,jjp333,July 18 2017,348,"You know there was nothing wrong with this place, and the value was good. If it was in a different place it would probably stand out as good, but here it is just okay. There are so many good restaurants, this one just didn't stand out. Service was a little rushed and not overly helpful, again, food was decent but nothing spectacular.",332
3.0,F3R7N,May 27 2017,64,"Well, the food is far better than the atmosphere, let's put it this way. We had good portions and good quality food delivered quite fast.",332
3.0,Keith D,January 9 2017,312,We fancied a change from classic French food and this place and menu looked good from the outside. Admittedly there were only 4 people in when we arrived but it felt like a morgue. The service was equally hesitant and communication hard work. The food and prices were generally ok but not a place I could honestly recommend.,332
3.0,steve r,September 26 2016,91,Not great food but lots of it. If you're hungry then you may enjoy it but our food was over seasoned not particularly great. Not enough flavourings to make you want to go back - had much better chinese food on many occasions.,332
4.0,Gaby B,August 6 2016,514,"A word of advice about the menu: it is big!. The salad on its own might be enough for a lot of people. It would have been better to share one menu among two people. The food was very good, very tasty. I was particularly impressed by the cook/waiter/dish washer that was multitasking and doing everything on its own that day with so much dedication and patience. While i definitely think the place was understaffed, this man was a living proof of hard work and dedication because for us, there was no much delay (maybe there was some for the tables that arrived before).",332
5.0,SueBM,April 24 2016,119,After a few weeks in France we were hankering for some Asian cuisine. This restaurant did not disappoint. The owners were welcoming and the food was very tasty. We particularly liked the chicken with cashews.,332
5.0,Edward J,February 1 2016,100,"Wow, what a find! We love Vietnamese and Chinese and this resturant really delivers on quality and flavor. If you need a break from french cuisine, you must visit here. Excellent, well done! We had the Peking duck and the salt and pepper squid. They were both absolutely amazing!",332
5.0,Brisbane-Paddington,October 28 2015,19,"After spending 4 weeks in Europe it was lovely to find this Vietnamese restaurant, which servers excellent stir fries and sizzling hot plates. Excellent seafood, meats and duck and lots of vegetables. A must for Australians in Lyon!",332
4.0,DavinaC54,June 7 2015,40,"We arrived in Lyon on a Sunday afternoon and many restaurants were closing. Restaurant du boeuf was open, the owner was most welcoming and helpful with the menu. The food was very good, and for us (Australians) we so appreciated really cold beer! We had attentive service too during the meal. In particular, the beef spring rolls were wonderful!",332
4.0,Eat or Die: Krakow Gourmands,April 2 2015,999,"We passed by this small place and saw the sign advertising pho. As we would be eating a big dinner , a light lunch appealed to us. The owner was very polite and we sat down to beer and very generous bowls of this lovely Vietnamese soup. There were the usual condiments though some fresh basil would not have been amiss. Plenty of beef and noodles and a relaxing atmosphere made for a pleasant meal.",332
5.0,Pr_review,September 29 2013,57,"We dropped by the ""Restaurant du Boeuf"" on a rainy day in Lyon, wanting to dry ourselves and get something to eat. Boy where we surprised by the quality of the food. It was absolutely delicious, unlike anything we've eaten in other vietnamese restaurants. We would highly recommend the 'chicken in honey' and the 'chicken soup' which we found particularly nice. The place was quite empty while we were there and the service was speedy. Also no problems regarding cleanliness; everything was top notch.",332
3.0,Tark_Mwain,March 24 2013,57,"Located in the historic center of Lyon, this restaurant has very good and affordable Vietnamese and Thai food. Nice setting, simple. The restaurant seems to be family run and have its own regular customers, whom the owners greeted very loudly, kissing cheeks and all, while ignoring us completely. The owners sat always in the back, at a table, using their computers and cell phones. Our waiter was their daughter, who first indicated to us a table which was dirty. When we explained that we want a clean table (the rest of the place was more than half empty), she just shrugged and showed us her back. Interestingly enough, until we left (maybe 1.5 hours later), she never cleaned the 3 little tables which were dirty in the first place. She was also very slow in waiting us, she avoided eye contact with us, sticking to her phone in the back of the room. Although the food was very good, we always had to make an effort to capture her attention and have the plates changed etc, etc. Too bad for the food, that the service was less than poor. If the service was a bit better, my rating would be at least Very Good. I would go back for the food, if someone else would be my waiter:)",332
4.0,Marie-Noëlle B,November 23 2024,84,Everyone is very friendly and caring. The food is good. The super-soft chicken. I missed a touch of perfume and flavors. I recommend it anyway.,332
