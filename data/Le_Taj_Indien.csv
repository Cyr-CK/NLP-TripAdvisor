5.0,Aileann P,October 28 2023,1,"My colleagues and I were overwhelmed by the richness of the menu. Generous starters and well-stocked side dishes (a wide variety of naan, rice and vegetables). For vegetarians, unsurprisingly, you will find what you are looking for and even sensitive palates will be able to sleep peacefully: attentive service. Spicy or not, the dishes are excellent. I recommend the salty cumin lassi and a goat cheese naan to accompany! We will come back.",210

5.0,ManoCCC,August 5 2023,3867,"Great discovery... this restaurant is now part of our Top 3 of the best Indians in Lyon. Because the menu is provided... a never-before-seen assortment of Nans. I recommend the chef's nan, Because the flavors are there, The desserts are good and original (pistachio ice cream and semolina cake), Because the service is fast and attentive... In short, we recommend it... We took the menu for 36â‚¬. It's very very hearty. We finished with the f Doggy bag offered by the waiter",210
3.0,ArunBains,December 31 2020,50,"The food was presented well and fairly good ingredients. But itâ€™s very expensive for chicken that looked like it had been cooked days ago and reheated, same for the samosas. The lamb was tough and not cooked well at all. The spices were fairly well balanced.",210
2.0,paolo69,May 13 2024,342,"Don't be fooled by the comments, the decoration is beautiful but that's all. Being Indian, this restaurant has adapted to Europe. It's super expensive for what you eat. I won't go so far as to say that it's bland but you pay for the setting. I absolutely did not find any Indian flavors in my lunch. No interest especially since the service is long. And then, serve halwa with strawberries...seriously? Strawberries are not part of Indian cuisine",210
5.0,Serpollet,August 12 2023,152,"Nice typical setting. Smiling welcome. Efficient service. The dishes are classic and excellent. We ask you the strength you want for those which are spicy. The nans are a little too thin for my taste which does not justify removing a star.A great address for those who want to eat Indian in Lyon, and ideally located right in the center in the heart of very lively streets.",210

5.0,Manon_and_off,August 11 2024,39,"We ordered an entrance to shared the eggplant donuts were delicious! It is a very good idea to offer several sauces for each taste and tolerance to chilli. The dishes are hearty and delicious, there are many choices. The restaurant is well decorated and very clean, the service fast, very professional and pleasant. The cocktails are really good, especially the mojito which is excellent. For dessert we took lassis, very fresh and very good.",210

4.0,Marshall B,November 4 2024,5229,"Really important to reserve here or get there early â€“ there were very few tables left, and it was a Tuesday evening. There are many restaurants on this street, but this is the only Indian one. Very good service and very good food. We took the menu, which included appetizer, bread (Naan), main course, and dessert. And that was a lot â€“ we also got (extra) rice. Not one of us went away hungry!",210

1.0,Chippywarner,June 6 2022,214,Visited based on TripAdvisor recommendations and hoped to get a good experience before I moved on to the south of France the next day. There was one guy serving. I arrived at 8 pm and didnâ€™t order until about 8:20. Starter and main turned up about 8:40 and then I didnâ€™t see the waiter for the next half an hour. Eventually I stood up and went to the bar and asked for the bill. Absolutely hopeless. All the tables around me having the same problem and looking at me with a sort of embarrassed silence. Dreadful place. Avoid.,210
1.0,Keval M,December 7 2021,3,I don't like leaving negative reviews but this establishment deserves one. The palak paneer we ordered was watered down and tasteless but what made it a terrible experience was the extremely rude staff. When I tried to provide feedback their attitude was like we don't care just give us your credit card and leave.,210
5.0,Chris H,August 24 2020,49,"we received a table without reservation. The place has has nice indian and asian decoration at the wall, which makes you feel in another world. The food is delicious and the service very friendly.",210
3.0,AnkRun,October 10 2019,20,"One thing I have figured out that never trust the reviews on tripadvisor as they are misleading. I had dinner in this restaurant and travelled far after seeing the decor and reviews and also in their menu they have 2 paneer dishes and I was looking forward to eat them and when I ordered, it turned out they donâ€™t have those dishes, that was setback number 1, I had to order from what little choices I was left with, I ordered dal makhani and mix veg, I had never ever seen a dal makhani like this which is yellow more like dal tadka and mix veg was full of oil, one thing was common both of them didnâ€™t taste good at all and only saviour was garlic naan. Service was absolutely rubbish, to order something or request for something I had to get up and search for the server. Server was a young boy who was just not interested in what he was doing. Real pity that they invested in decor but forgot to invest in what really matters, a good chef and servers. Apart from decor other thing they got right is the pricing as itâ€™s reasonably priced. Hugely disappointing to say the least. Indian restaurants outside UK are total useless as they dont know what they are doing",210
2.0,Chetan A,July 4 2019,7,We went this afternoon for lunch ..food was nothing great and oily ..worked out very expensive also.would not recommend...,210
5.0,njpump,June 11 2019,38,"Decor was great, food was amazing. We went back multiple times!! The restaurant ran out of paneer but made some vegetarian accommodations. The vegetarian entrees, naan, lassi, and rice were all delicious. The staff was friendly, prices were reasonable.",210
5.0,Peter O,September 9 2018,647,"We fancied Asian food in Lyon on a Sunday for lunch and one of the best rated places happened to be this Indian. And we were not disappointed, the indoor seating is quite posh and cosy at the same time, the menu deals are good value and some of the food as well as the Lassis are excellent. We will be back!",210
2.0,Babar1234,February 15 2018,72,"Very nice ambience in a nice location. Presentation of food seems to be more important than taste. We had four different vegetarian dishes, which basically meant all available since they were out of paneer. Small portions. One was fairly well balanced, but a bit strange in taste. Very mild. The rest were sadly very bland. Even the chili naan was devoid of heat. This was our first experience of Indian cooking in France and it might be adapted to French taste. If you are looking for spicy food, look elsewhere.",210
3.0,Muriel,January 26 2018,39,"Food was good but nothing to write home about when you lived 20 years in London's East end! The 20% off at 7pm that appealed to us originally were totally misleading, as in, my main and rice were not even taken into consideration for the 20% off (we had a 45 euro bill, so it wasn't a big chunk of the total bill, was it?) because apparently it's not just the ""wine and set menus"" that are off the deal but also the ""a la carte"" stuff IF you do not take a dessert or a starter with your main.... It was just 2 euros to take off to make me happy (8 + 3 euros) and he didn't bulge. Lousy manager. Knowing very well we ordered off the deal all the way (when we asked when we sat down before ordering ""is it just the menus and wine off the deal?"", waiter didn't know, fair enough, but the manager should have told us we would have ordered a la carte instead of menu (i didn't care for the dessert anyways !). We won't come back, we told him so and he still didn't do a gesture. Rip off.",210
5.0,Mike L,September 21 2017,124,"Simply the best indian meal we have ever found in France. We eat a lot of curry in the UK but really enjoyed the food here. It had fantastic flavours, was subtle and not too hot. beautifully presented and the portions were generous . A brilliant experience.",210
5.0,OU812Kiev,August 13 2017,265,"It's not easy to find good Indian food in Lyon. But I found it last night at Taj Indien.This is authentic and delicious! I tried chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, lamb curry, palak paneer (the best of all the dishes), eggplant, naan, rice, and raita, Every dish was well reviewed by our group, except the eggplant which we didn't love but didn't hate either. Very friendly service too, even if it was a little slow and chaotic on a busy Saturday night. But the great food and friendliness made up for any service mistakes. I will return, soon.",210
