5.0,Flavio P,August 22 2024,1,"At the corner of a subway exit , a small luminescent and solar beam makes its way peacefully to the retina , before we enthusiastically decide to meet this Italian getaway. Painters were once obliged to travel to the oldest country in the world in order to absorb the intrinsic beauty of this wonderful place. You have to believe that today, it is next to Place Guichard that this trip to Italy takes place in the most fantastic way. How many impressionistic brushstrokes could sum up this teeming of light and emotions that pass through us when we stop there. Whether on the banks of Awards accessible to the sublime enclave of a cascade of tastes , like the eruption of a Vesuvius or an Etna: the awful Jojo has nothing but the name , and I wish, from my humble experience , to pay tribute to one of the most dignified restaurants I have ever met. Caravaggio",16
