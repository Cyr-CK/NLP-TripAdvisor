5.0,Tom P,October 17 2021,577,"Great place for both food and service. A very casual atmosphere and the owners were very polite and kind, making sure we understood the menu. The food was fantastic, very flavourful but not too rich. Something we enjoyed after a few days in Lyon. The OEuf Parfait was the best dish of the night but they all complimented each other. Great contemporary blend of Italian and French! Thanks",3
5.0,LA1289,August 2 2022,202,"French Italian fusion, the best of both cuisines, artfully combined. Everything was made in-house, from the pasta to the breads. There was attention to detail and intensity of flavors. On a blazingly hot summer night, a cold tomato soup with a dollop of mustard ice cream was a stroke of genius. The atmosphere was casual, the manager very attentive, and the chef/wait staff beamed as they presented their creations. Highly recommended!",3
5.0,May,September 23 2021,2,"We've closed here a 3 weeks trip throughout france, ate in a michellen restaurants and had the absolute best time ever in FRAZARIN. These welcoming guys were kind and not too serious, all with an amazing food, with the best of both Italian and French kitchens. The chef did a special dish for us, just because we've asked and the stuff are intelligent, speaks English (!) and sensitive. We only had one night in lyon and are super glad we've spent it here. Do the same!",3
5.0,Brendan H,February 12 2022,1,"This restaurant is a real piece of Lyon. It was recommended to me by several friends who live in the city and I was not disappointed. Not only is the service impeccable, but the food is of such a high quality that one wonders if the bill was correct! I cannot recommend enough a meal at this restaurant, whether it’s lunch or dinner, I’ve never been disappointed by the high quality of service and the excellent food.",3
5.0,Paul A,September 26 2024,1,"The food and service were outstanding. Max the owner sat down with us and explained the menu in english. We each had 3 course prefix price meal and all enjoyed different starters, both main courses and 3 different desserts. All of the dishes were excellent especial my mussels and my fish (pollock). Clean preparation with wonderful sauces and ingredients. Max is very friendly and the entire atmosphere is informal with emphasis on wanting each customer to have a great meal. Wine selection extensive and very good. We just had a wonderful time.",3
5.0,MareileObi,February 4 2021,5,"From what I learned from the owners (3 young French guys) their restaurant was open for one day, before they had to close dur to COVID regulations. Nevertheless, they seem do be doing great with excellent take away choices and always a smile on their face. Really cool place. Apparently they now also have a stand on a weekly market nearby. The food we ordered (Canneloni with fresh spinach and marcarpone) was delicious and their desserts... well... I could come JUST for the desserts. Great option when in Lyon!",3
5.0,Christopher L,April 12 2023,9,"Excellent dinner in friendly surrounding. Small but perfectly balanced menu with a well matched choice of wines. The dishes were very well prepared and presented, with good sized but not excessive portions. Highly recommended",3
5.0,Meath82,April 27 2023,31,I booked this restaurant after reading reviews and we were not disappointed. I booked a few weeks in advance and booking was taken and we received a call the day before to confirm. We had a really beautful meal which we really enjoyed. The service is very personable and every dish and wine was explained to us. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The owners took time to talk to us even with a busy sitting and explain their concept and recommend wine. One of our best meals in Lyon. I hope to revisit soon.,3
5.0,JPDH52,September 15 2023,39,"Superb in every respect, from the very friendly welcome and explanation of the restaurant and the menu, very tolerant of our inadequate French, we felt more than comfortable in this wonderful bistro. Marvellous characteristics of every dish were the extremely clever balance of flavours, which saw the primary ingredients stand out, perfectly complemented by extremely clever and subtle accompanying flavours.  We were particularly glad we opted for Frazarin’s wine matching, which showed great knowledge of the wines and delivered us a selection of perfectly matched wines for each dish.  The service was interested, perfectly timed, confident and very friendly. It’s only the really good restaurants which can generate a sense of well-being in the way Frazarin so quickly did, and sustained. We left busily planning a return visit.",3
5.0,Lina K,November 18 2023,9,"The idea of tasting an italian-french dinner sounded very intriguing so we made a reservation. What we experienced was beyond our expectations. A very warm and welcoming place and staff, freshly made quality dishes, delicious from the appetizer to the dessert, a wide wine list, fair pricing. We had an excellent dinner. Congratulations!",3
5.0,Caroline S,September 3 2022,2,"Incredible experience! We went for lunch and were greeted by one of the owners, Max, who gave us an overview of the origin of the restaurant, including the combined French and Italian heritages of the owners. He also walked through every menu item with us in English, explaining each. He was incredibly accommodating. The food was absolutely incredible!! The ambience is very modern with art on the walls depicting the story of the restaurant. It’s was an excellent experience and the best meal we had in Lyon.",3
5.0,danlev,November 3 2024,195,"This is a warm, happy place. The owners are hands-on waiting tables and you can tell they love what they do. The food is very good. My starter was a pair of chicken croquettes in a subtle and tasty broth. The main, beef cheeks, was flavorful and extremely tender. The bill for my starter plus main? All of 20 euros.",3
5.0,Paul,February 22 2022,7,"Discovered this restaurant through Trip Adviser in preparation for our short stay in Lyon. Lived up to expectations; very friendly staff and very good food. Menu is not vast, and you get to choose from from three different dishes for each of first course, main and dessert. All courses were nicely presented, which helped us have a memorable culinary experience. Highly recommended. Price was reasonable for what we had.",3
5.0,Evelyne S,October 1 2024,4,"Absolutely great evening - menue was translated into English (sorry, our French was not good enough). Small card but rather small and fresh. Two cooks in open kitchen. They did a fabulous job. We all enjoyed it and our dog was treated nicely and slept most of the time whilst we indulged in tasty dishes. The staff did brilliantly. Best floating chocolate cake and home-made icecream ever! Definitely recommend it and will come back!",3
5.0,M@lt,October 17 2024,270,"Already at the entrance, we are welcomed with kindness. The service is personalized because we take the time to explain the menu. You can’t expect a very diverse menu, but what’s on offer is well cooked and sought after. In short, it is true that it is good.",3
5.0,Julien T,November 30 2022,5,"Was on a lay over in Lyon for couple days with friends and we were looking for a cute spot in the food capital of the world. What a gem we found! Frazarin is the perfect mix between refinement and rustic chic, between the amazing Italian products of Italy, sublimed by some proper french cooking technics. We met Maxence and Quentin on the floor who we thank for their welcome, kindness and professionalism, and extended knowledge in wine ! To sum it up, great spot for a pasta and a Vino at Lunch, or an extended diner with friends!",3
5.0,Guido Casanova,September 2 2022,8,"Even we didn’t have a reservation we were welcomed very friendly. The choice of plates is limited, which means that the quality has to be good. The Arrancinis better than in Sicily. The mussels so soft - I can’t remember a better taste. The codfish soft with white beans - excellent. The dessert a dream. For me the perfect fusion of French and Italian cuisine.",3
5.0,David J,March 4 2023,1,We had a wonderful time. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and Quintan and Max really understand the art of creating the right timing of service and are able to make you feel welcome. We were here with our 2 sons (Morris and Merlijn) and the food was excellent. Definitely worth a visit.,3
5.0,LKCR32,October 26 2024,153,"Frazarin is a must do in Lyon! My husband and I both enjoyed a gourmet 3-course meal, with a lovely bottle of wine that complimented the dishes perfectly. The owners both seated and served us and were very friendly and engaging all throughout the evening. Prices were very reasonable for such outstanding food. Overall had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend it!",3
5.0,Nancy P,May 26 2023,8,"This is a wonderful restaurant. Max explained the menu to us and chose a great wine. Our meals were outstanding - the tuna was one of the best dishes I have ever had, with a delightful mix of delicate flavors. We hope to return before we leave Lyon.",3
5.0,MarianaCortes,March 30 2024,29,"We reserved to have dinner because the combination of Italian and French cuisine sounded a great option. And it was. Small menu, well presented and tasted even better. Service is done by the owners and there is always a smile and a nice recommendation.",3
5.0,claudiabk2020,June 11 2024,1,"While passing through Lyon with a friend, I had previously spotted this restaurant for its local cuisine and pleasant setting. We wanted to have fish but as the day before was a public holiday, there was no more. So we chose veal instead. Result: We enjoyed ourselves, very tender meat, decorated with a succulent sage sauce, all accompanied by caramelized potatoes, a real delight. The same goes for the starter and dessert. I would come back without hesitating.",3
5.0,faby b,October 22 2023,2,"A little nugget not at all hidden but where you must reserve. The three associates are super welcoming, smiling and friendly despite a full Saturday evening service. The advice was perfect and the food incredible! This Franco-Italian concept works perfectly and our table of 4 where we had eggs meurettes, cod, fresh pasta and cabbage for dessert was 100% satisfied with the balance of the dishes and their flavors! Thank you for this beautiful evening, we recommend 1000%",3
5.0,jennie1,July 2 2024,19,We picked Frazarin because of the reviews but nothing prepared us for just how fabulous the evening would be. The guys who run this have paid much attention to detail. We were welcomed and seated with easy conversation about a shared interest - football! And Max even resembles his favourite footballer! We observed the same careful attention being paid to everyone who arrived after us. After that the menu was described beautifully and the wine choices were thoughtfully recommended. The food was truly exceptional. We loved every course. My only disappointment is that we live so far away. When we return to Lyon this will be our first restaurant booking. It is certainly the best restaurant we have found in a long time. Thank you guys - you were superb!!,3
5.0,Kelly D,September 12 2024,22,"Fantastic meal, our best in France to date. intimate bistro featuring an ever changing and creative French/Italian inspired menu. The three owners are onsite and take pride in the art of cooking, not to mention they are inviting and friendly and explain the menu in English if needed. Excellent wine list as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",3
5.0,aquario13,October 22 2024,173,"My rather Italian dinner with en Entry (unfortunately unclear picture): gnudi (kind of gnocchi) toscani, ricotta e spinacci, broth e lardo colonnata. It is in the form of a sphere - ricotta e spinacci), actually rolled in colonnata, very thin slice of fried white bacon, resembling a Ha Kao but more translucent.

5.0,explorer1905,September 9 2024,52,"We had a fantastic meal and a magical evening at Frazarin in late August. We were traveling through Lyon on our way to Provence, and chose Frazarin because of the wonderful reviews in a couple different sites. The food was so delicious! The tomato tart was bursting with the tastes of summer, and the mussels with leek and curry and haddock toast may be one of the best things I've ever eaten. The fig leaf ice cream with the roasted fig was so delicate - I know I'll remember it for a long long time.  We also enjoyed meeting Quentin, Maxence and Harold. They made us feel so welcome and treated each customer with such careful attention, it was very, very special. Merci!",3

Simple menu (four starters, 2 main course, 3 desserts from memory) goes together with sophisticated dishes using fresh ingredients for a reasonable price, mixing french and Italian influences. Starters ‘Jus de Tomate’ is quite amazing, so is ‘oeuf parfait’, the raviole main meat course was very well executed and full of flavor, and the chef could also adapt the menu to kids taste. ‘The ‘pêche rotie’ dessert was a really nice ending, as was the ‘Chou à la crème with strawberries’. Good selection of wine (including by the glass), Nice bistrot design, open kitchen, good service. What else? We enjoyed a lot!
