# Scraper NLP Tripadvisor

This project demonstrates the use of NLP practices by deploying analysis and models. It focuses on scraping reviews from Tripadvisor based on user feedback.

## Architecture

A scraper (BeautifulSoup) is used to gather restaurant data from all review pages. These reviews are saved into a PostgreSQL database, which is accessed by a Python backend. The data is then displayed on a Streamlit frontend for analysis. Additionally, an LLM from Mistral AI is used to summarize each restaurant's positive and negative points based on the comments.

## DataBase
The database follows a star schema, dividing locations, reviews, and restaurant information into separate tables. For improvement, consider adding another table for users instead of saving user information in the reviews table.

# How to Set Up

## API Keys Setup

You can configure the API keys in two ways:

### 1. Local Environment Variables

Docker will take local variables from your environment file or machine. You can configure it using an `.env` file like the following:

```sh
DB=postgres
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_USER=nlp
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=nlp
POSTGRES_DBNAME=nlp
POSTGRES_PORT=32001

MISTRAL_URL=http://mistralservice:8501
MISTRAL_API_KEY=${MISTRAL_API_KEY}
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}
```

### 2. Direct Modification

Before starting, you need API keys from different services. Follow the steps below to obtain and configure the necessary keys.

Ensure your `docker-compose` file includes the following environment variables:
```yaml
environment:
    - MISTRAL_API_KEY=${MISTRAL_API_KEY}
    - GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}
```


### Mistral AI

1. **Create an account:**
    If you don't have an account, register at [Mistral AI](https://auth.mistral.ai/ui/registration).

2. **Add billing information:**
    Go to [Mistral AI Billing](https://console.mistral.ai/billing/) and follow the instructions to add your billing information and credit balance.

3. **Generate an API key:**
    Visit [Mistral AI API Keys](https://console.mistral.ai/user/api-keys/) and click "Generate a new key". Copy the key and add it to your environment variables. If you are using a Unix-based OS, you can add it to your local environment variables with the name `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, and Docker will automatically use it. Alternatively for Windows users, you can directly replace `${MISTRAL_API_KEY}` in the `docker-compose` file.

### Google Maps

1. **Get an API key:**
    Follow the instructions at [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to obtain your API key.

2. **Configure the API key:**
    Add the key to your environment variables. If you are using a Unix-based OS, you can add it to your local environment variables with the name `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, and Docker will automatically use it. Alternatively, for Windows users, you can directly replace `${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}` in the `docker-compose` file.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP-TripAdvisor.git
    cd NLP-TripAdvisor
    ```
    Ensure you have Docker installed and run:

2. **Docker setup:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

3. **Access the web application:**
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8052`
